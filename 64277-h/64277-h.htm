<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Story Behind These Letters</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE most refreshing thing about these letters
is that they are real letters, written by a
real salesman to a real son. Therein they
differ from so many books of this character. There
is a certain satisfaction in knowing that what you
are reading was written by a man who has been
through the mill.</p>

<p>Another refreshing thing about these letters is
that they were not written for publication. The
motive behind them is an interesting one. Mr. James
began his business career as a salesman, calling on
the retail trade in small towns. Shortly after a son
came to bless his home&mdash;a red-headed boy who was
christened “Hal.” Like all men who make a success
of their profession, Mr. James believed in his work
and his dreams of the future for his son always
pictured the boy as a traveling salesman. As the
boy grew and developed traits of character, what
was more natural than that his dad, who shared the
boy’s problems, should visualize his son with these
same peculiar traits running afoul of the same pitfalls
and snags that beset the path of every young
man in sales work? What was more natural than
that he should try to impart to his boy the secrets
of his success as a salesman and manager of salesmen,
so that the son might use the father’s achievement
as a short cut?</p>

<p>Through some underground avenue, best known
to himself, it came to the attention of the editor of
the Libby house-organ that Mr. James&mdash;then a department
manager&mdash;was writing a series of most
interesting human letters to his boy. After much
persuasion Mr. James agreed to the anonymous
publication of these letters&mdash;with deletions of a
personal character&mdash;in the Libby salesman’s bulletin.
For two years the letters of an old time salesman
to his son were the most eagerly read feature of one
of the most readable of salesmen’s publications.</p>

<p>After the letters had run the gamut from salesman
to general sales manager, during the writing of
which the author himself had risen to the position
of General Sales Manager of his Company, they
came to an end. That they had exerted a powerful
influence in moulding the character of every Libby
salesman there can be no question. No man could
read the letters without being the better for having
done so. And I feel that Mr. James in permitting
the publication of them in book form, so that the
message they carry may be spread out beyond the
limited confines of the Libby organization and conveyed
to every man who sells things, has taken a big
step toward fulfilling the obligation which every
man owes to his profession. If every salesman could
read this book it would do more for the cause of
better, cleaner salesmanship than any other one
thing.</p>

But Full of Pep</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Your letter written as you had just finished your
first week as a cub salesman was received and
I’ve enjoyed reading it over, two or three times, because
it brings out the fact that after all, the game
doesn’t change a great deal in fundamentals since
the time I used to beat the brush.</p>

<p>I notice that you’re impressed with the fact that
it was pretty easy for the regular salesman Ryan to
sell goods, and that you think he’s a wonderful salesman.
Now, of course, I never met Ryan and I don’t
doubt from what you say that he is fairly popular
with the trade, knows the line and is a hard worker,
but from some of the things you say, I’m not exactly
sure that Ryan is the man who wrote the first book
on salesmanship, but, of course, I may be mistaken.
With all due respect to Ryan, you must remember
that your company was manufacturing and marketing
food products long before Ryan was strong
enough to shake a rattle.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not trying to belittle the honest sales
effort of yourself or your friend Ryan in the least,
but I just want to be sure that you appreciate the
fact that your success last week wasn’t due 100 per
cent to the siren voice of your salesmanship, but
that a great big piece of credit was due to the solid
foundation on which you were building your sales.</p>

<p>I notice you sort of “bragged” over the fact that
you sold only the <i>best merchants</i> in each town and
those who were capable of giving orders worth
while. If I had to take my choice between five nice
new ten dollar bills and five old ragged ones, why,
of course, I’d choose the crinkly kind, but if there
wasn’t any law against my getting both piles, I
don’t think I’d be so particular, because it has been
my experience that the ragged ones can be changed
into just as many dimes and quarters as the new
ones, and either one is acceptable to the receiving
teller when you pass the little black book under the
wicket on Saturday.</p>

<p>Now the matter of choice in selling retailers is
just the same. With a line like your company has,
in the first place you should attempt to place it in a
big way in the best stores in the town, but there isn’t
any game law against selling it to the little fellow
around the corner, is there? Nobody in “the house”
ever told you to beware of selling the small merchant,
did they? You bet they didn’t! In fact, every
successful business has been founded on the small
customer, who afterward grew into the big one. You
know when Marshall Field first started in business
his store didn’t cover a city block, but I suppose
there were some two and three-quarters per cent
salesmen in those days who thought Field’s business
was too small to bother with, but if any of those
salesmen are still living you can probably find them
now acting as a nurse-girl to a wheezy taxicab.</p>

<p>Notice you say Ryan told you the reason he didn’t
call on some merchants was because there was no
use&mdash;they couldn’t be sold. I’ll never forget, the
fellow who broke me in as a salesman told me the
same thing my first week as we were getting off a
train in a little Missouri town that had only two
stores in it. He said that the one customer we sold
there was the much better merchant of the two and it
was no use to go near the other one.</p>

<p>Well, I believed him, and made my one call in the
town regularly and received the one order and
thought I was doing pretty well until one day, when
I called, my customer informed me that he had just
sold out to the other merchant across the street and
that henceforth there would be only one store there.</p>

<p>Of course, I went over and tried to sell the
other fellow, but he naturally wondered why I’d
never called before and I didn’t have any very good
answer. The result was that I was beaten by my
own stupidity and I had to call on that fellow for
six months before I ever scratched an order book.</p>

<p>Now that is only one of many instances I could
tell you, but I’ve found that there is one thing that,
as a salesman, you must never take another man’s
word for and that is that So-and-So across the
street, or around the corner, will not buy. I’ve
always found it a safe rule to call on every man who
had his door unlocked and the worst thing that ever
happened to me in applying the rule, was to get an
occasional turn-down, while I have had the surprise
of my life many times, to see what big orders you
could get out of a little store.</p>

<p>The longer you sell goods, the more you’ll realize
that it’s a battle from start to finish, but just take it
from the old man that you’ll have more luck capturing
an increase in salary at the end of the year with
a whole army of little dough-boy customers on your
list than you will by trying to impress the boss with
a giant named Goliath who is a single-footer.</p>

“Regular” Salesman</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Your mother and I have just finished reading
your last letter, and while I realize that you may be
getting pretty well fed up on my letters, I cannot
help commenting on some of the things you have
written about.</p>

<p>I imagine it is just about as much fun for you to
get one of my letters as holding a horse in a rain.
You probably look on them as containing the proverbial
“good advice.” I can almost hear you saying
more men have starved to death on good advice than
were ever killed on the field of battle.</p>

<p>All of that I’ll admit, but words from an old traveler
of the road you’ve just started on is a good deal
like castor oil&mdash;you kick up a lot of fuss if you have
to take it when you’re young, but as you grow older
you realize that it didn’t hurt you a bit and in most
cases prolonged the life of your “engine.”</p>

<p>I notice that you have gone just far enough in the
selling game to discover that your goods are higher
priced than every competitor’s; the merchants overloaded;
business on the bum; the office manager a
crab; the credit man hard-boiled and the plant
unappreciative of what a salesman is up against.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;now, isn’t that just too bad! But doesn’t
it occur to you that with everything so badly messed
up, it is strange that the firm continues to worry
along and pay dividends on its stock, year after
year? Of course, the buyer tells you your prices are
too high&mdash;otherwise he wouldn’t be the buyer, but
would more probably be rolling barrels of salt
around in the basement for a living&mdash;you don’t
expect him to ask you to add a little to the price,
do you? And man alive!&mdash;if the goods would sell
themselves your company could replace you with a
post-card.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, they thought best to hire a
1922 model eight-cylinder salesman, like you (you
scamp) instead of trying to get by with a two-cylinder
flivver that isn’t a self-starter.</p>

<p>Business is bum, eh? I’m sorry you told me because
that’s the cry of the quitter and I hate to
think you would make a phonograph record of yourself.
Business is bad for some people all the time
and similarly, business is good for others most of
the time. Now I’m willing to admit, understand,
that there are business lulls in all lines, but if you’ll
trace back the origin of that expression, I’ll wager
you’ll find the thought was first expressed by one of
those hotel lobby lizards who got used to the buyer
hunting him up during the recent period of big demand
and small supply. To the fellow who really
loves the game (and if you don’t you shouldn’t be
in it) the changed conditions, or the lull, if you
prefer that name, only means more “turndowns”
which can be overcome by “more calls” and at the end
of the day, he finds he’s been too busy to notice that
lull and his order-book may reflect smaller orders,
but gee&mdash;he’s got a lot of ’em!</p>

<p>And the office Manager’s a crab; and the credit
man hard-boiled;&mdash;well now, what do you think of
that! Of course, the Office Manager should be a
mind-reader and overlook it when you send in claims
without the proper information, or reports only
half-filled out, but somehow or other he isn’t&mdash;no,
he’s just human like all the rest of us&mdash;has a lot to
do and the company don’t pay him for “guessing”
at things you do.</p>

<p>The credit man is another good friend and a salesman’s
safety valve. Both of ’em are the easiest men in
the world to get popular with, but you have to do
your share and come clean. Sloppy reports and incorrect
information may be the easiest way out for the
moment, but they never fool these “watch dogs of the
exchequer,” and after all, if it were not for them,
your pay check wouldn’t come out so regularly.</p>

<p>Now you’re wrong again, when you think the plant
superintendent doesn’t appreciate your problems.
He gives them really more thought than you do, for
you have only one house to work with, while he has
to try to answer the demands of six hundred
salesmen.</p>

<p>Now, Old Top, I expect you think I have stepped
on you pretty hard in this letter, but I haven’t intended
to. If you weren’t my own boy, I imagine I’d
expect less of you, but it’s pretty hard for the old
man, knowing that a great big red-headed human
dynamo, with hair on his upper lip, would bear even
the earmarks of a whiner, not to appeal to your better
judgment by making fun of the petty trials that
every red-blooded salesman has gone through and
graduated from, just like you got over the nursing
bottle, measles and mumps.</p>

<p>But, anyway&mdash;read this letter twice, then remember,
I’m laying a little bet on you and am anxious to
get your next letter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Boy_Thinks_the_House_Should"><i>The Boy Thinks the House Should
Accept Cancellations</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>For the past few months I have allowed your
mother to do all the letter-writing from this end; in
fact, Mother has become a pretty important factor
around here since she has been given the vote. She
insists that the home be in her name and my insurance
in her name, so I’ve consented, and further
allowed her to carry my religion in her name.</p>

<p>My chief reason for not writing sooner is that I
wanted to wait until you had graduated into a “jobbing”
salesman, because I knew you would eventually
do so, and that with the new job would come
new problems to talk about.</p>

<p>Yes, the jobbing game is quite a little different
from selling the retailer, and I am glad to note that
you have already found that the average jobber
buyer is generally a pretty thorough business man,
quite cold and calculating, and is more susceptible
to quality and price than he is to a salesman’s personality,
funny stories or the odor of “moonshine.”</p>

<p>Note you say you think that your company is making
a mistake in not accepting cancellations of contracts
with certain of their jobbing customers who
have been pretty hard hit on sugar declines, and
that you’re afraid your company will not do much
business with those customers again, on account of
refusing to “accommodate” them.</p>

<p>Say&mdash;Boy&mdash;just how do you get that way?</p>

<p>You think your company should bear “part” of
the load, eh? You know one trouble with you aggressive,
red-blooded, two-fisted “kids” (as you’ll
always be to me, Red) is that you don’t look backward
or forward far enough.</p>

<p>Now let’s look back a little. ’Way back last Spring
your company came out with their opening prices
on the goods they sell for Fall Delivery. On account,
primarily, of the experience of the Wholesale Grocers
over a long period of years, these jobbers
bought, and why? Because they wanted to assure
themselves of your company’s quality and against
the possibility of an advance in cost after the goods
were packed. That was their reason and now,
why did your company contract? Because they
wanted to assure themselves of a market for a certain
per cent of their pack so that their operations
would not be so speculative.</p>

<p>You know, no business that is purely speculative
is fundamentally sound.</p>

<p>Now this contract arrangement between your
company and the jobber was not philanthropic on
either side. For years this custom has existed in the
industry and has been found to be fashioned along
the lines of sound economics. It is not a one-sided
proposition by any means, for, if it were, it would
not have obtained over all these years. Sometimes
it has worked to the advantage of the canners, but
just as often it has worked to the advantage of the
jobber, depending entirely on conditions beyond the
control of either. While both canners and jobbers
may have been laying up treasures in heaven for
years, neither has so far had sufficient prestige with
the management to cause the rain, sun and frost to
act just right for the proper development of fruit
and vegetables, but under the contract system, both
are protected as far as possible to be fair to both
parties.</p>

<p>Now, Red, remember the entire commercial fabric
of our nation is built up on confidence, and confidence
can obtain only just so long as the integrity of
the business world is maintained by the recognition
of the validity of a contract entered into in good
faith between buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>All right&mdash;now this year, as usual, after making
these contracts with their wholesale grocer friends,
your company invested its money in tin cans, sugar,
boxes, other supplies and materials, contracted for
acreage, labor and everything else, bought a large
amount of their supplies long before they really
needed them, but they must necessarily take no
chances on failure. They borrowed money at prevailing
high rates to finance it.</p>

<p>Now listen, son, do you remember when you were
about nine years old, you wanted me to buy you a
shot gun and a lot of other fool-killer arrangements,
and you thought I was awfully hard-hearted because
I wouldn’t get ’em for you? I would have liked to
have gratified your desires, but, boy&mdash;it wasn’t good
business. So, also, the cancellations&mdash;your company
would like to “accommodate” their friends by canceling
their contracts if it would help them, but it
isn’t good business. If they did so, they would be
morally bound to cancel every contract, if requested,
because they should not do it for a few unless willing
to do it for all&mdash;they must treat all alike.</p>

<p>You know, everyone admires liberality, and similarly,
most people like to be liberal, but don’t get
away from the fact that in business you can be liberal
only up to a certain point, and after that it becomes
damfoolishness; and don’t worry about losing
the friendship of the customer requesting cancellation.
Any business man will admire you for being
a business man instead of a jelly-fish. He knows
he has no good business reason for expecting you to
cancel and, son, you’ll always make more friends
than enemies when you’ve the nerve to stand up
under fire when you’re in the right.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Boy_Has_Been_Promoted_to_a"><i>The Boy Has Been Promoted to a
“Special” Salesman</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Yes, I will admit that it begins to look like I never
write you any more except when you get a promotion,
but I wouldn’t advise you to figure on
that too closely, because sometimes I’m liable to
fool you.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I’m not much for writing letters
except when I have something to say, and when
you were a little fellow I found that while you were
susceptible to suggestions and advice, you were very
quick to resent overdoses, so I’ve come to look on
my letters a good deal like beef extract&mdash;a little of
it in a whole cup of hot water is a nice thing, but no
one relishes the idea of consuming a sixteen-ounce
jar at one sitting.</p>

<p>I was interested in your announcement that you
had been appointed a “special representative” and
will travel out of Chicago doing missionary work.
I wonder if you used that word “missionary” advisedly,
or if it merely dropped out as a careless
expression. Regardless of that, I’m sure you used
the right word, for as I understand it, that’s just
exactly what a “special representative” should be,
but I am wondering if you are sure you really understand
the full meaning of the word.</p>

<p>The usual adaptation of the word “missionary” as
used in business circles is, “one who is sent out to
generate, extend and foster business and all things
pertaining thereto, on a certain product.”</p>

<p>Now, the same relative difference exists between
a salesman and a “special representative” as does
between a common or garden variety of preacher
and a missionary, but the big trouble is a great many
people fail to analyze that difference, which accounts
for so many failures in the ranks of special representatives
and church missionaries.</p>

<p>Now, if you’ll go to the trouble to drop around
theoretically, to a “Home for Indigent (sounds like
‘indiligent,’ don’t it?) Business and Religious Missionary
Failures,” you’d find after talking with Exhibit
A and B their ideas of a missionary are a sort
of a combination hand-shaking, chicken-eating,
solicitous, dignified, well-dressed hombre, who sort
of exhaled good will and felicitations, who didn’t
have any duties in particular, but just traveled
around “for the good of the cause.” And, of course,
it goes without saying that that’s the reason why
they’re inmates of the Home.</p>

<p>It’s true that a missionary is a sort of supersalesman,
but it means “salesman plus” rather than
“graduate salesman.”</p>

<p>A real missionary goes into the highways and byways;
as the old fisherman says, “he ketches ’em
where they ain’t.” He generates enthusiasm in the
salesmen he comes in contact with; his sales work
is educational; he sets an example for industry,
sales ability, loyalty; he teaches the salesman to use
superior judgment in not selling too little or too
much to a customer; he irons out petty difficulties;
he’s an exponent of the sales theory that contemplates
holding your head up, but not so high as to let
a lot of little orders go by under your nose without
seeing them. Yet withal, he is humility personified,
which is the true mark of a great man.</p>

<p>Now, son, don’t tell me that I’m only telling you
stuff that you already know&mdash;of course, you know it&mdash;but
what I want to know, do you capitalize that
knowledge one hundred per cent?</p>

<p>Just remember, Red, when you go out on these
new jobs, there’s a Wrong Way and a Right Way.
You’ve traveled the road far enough to be able to
distinguish the sign posts. While the Boss and Dad
cannot see everything you do, it’s reflected in the
results, boy; it’s reflected in the results!</p>

Regarding Team Work</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>When Mother read me your letter announcing
that you had at last been appointed a Branch House
Manager, as well as your comments on just what it
meant to you, I thought I’d take time tonight to unburden
myself of some of my views in that connection,
that might be interesting to you at a time when
you were just starting the new work.</p>

<p>I am wondering if you fully appreciate the
difference in your position from a standpoint of
responsibility.</p>

<p>Up to now, you have been working entirely for
someone else and while you are still subject to considerable
supervision, in addition thereto, you will
now have others under your supervision&mdash;working
under you.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ve been through the different
stages of your company selling and around branch
houses long enough to have a good working idea of
the general routine of the work and I don’t doubt at
all, but what you will handle that end of your work
in good shape, but right now, at the start, Boy, let’s
look at the bigger, broader things that are expected
of you.</p>

<p>One of the first things that will impress you is
just how poor a salesman Smith is, over in the East
territory and what great weaknesses that new man
over South is already demonstrating. Your hands
will just fairly itch to grab hold and do it all yourself,
in your own way, which, of course, you think
is the only way, but <i>WHOA</i>&mdash;throw on the emergency,
Old Top, you’re skidding! You’re a hustler
all right and a good man, which you admit yourself,
but, Boy, you just cannot spread yourself out over
the whole territory and run the branch too, and
again, if your company had wanted you to do all
the selling they’d have told you so.</p>

<p>No, your job is to teach and lead others to do
most of the selling, reserving only the hard-boiled
and nursing-bottle customers that the other boys
cannot land, or for some reason seem to avoid.</p>

<p>I want to bear down a little on that remark “teach
and lead.” You know, back in the old days before
Bryan ever ran for President, which is longer than
you can remember, the popular belief was that the
best way to get the best results out of a man on any
job was for the Boss to be sort of a mixture of
Simon Legree, pyrotechnic cuss-words, bar-room
sarcasm and “<i>Drill ye Terriers, Drill</i>” policy, but
thanks to a revolutionary era which was directed
by common hog-sense, instead of the kind that the
butcher buys in five pound pails, that kind of man-management
has been tabooed.</p>

<p>Yes, I know&mdash;I know there are a lot of things
you’re not going to stand for and you’re all right in
it too. There are a lot of things you shouldn’t stand
for, as a Manager, but what I’m talking about, Red,
is the best way to go about to correct them.</p>

<p>Before you sit down and dictate that red hot, phosphorous,
steaming, sizzling letter to Hulbert on account
of the way he emphasized his unfortunate displacement
of bone, where gray matter should be,
stop a minute, Red, close your eyes a minute and
let this picture come back. Remember when you
were new, when you were beating the brush?&mdash;you
got in that town that’s always a Jonah; was raining
and had been all week; the farmers weren’t paying
their bills; it was inventory time and it just seemed
like every merchant you called on was just a little
more grouchy than the last; no one wanted your
goods, and after working hard all day in the rain
and snow, you ended up at a so-called hotel that
made you think of the Biltmore&mdash;it was so different!</p>

<p>You were hungry, but after a glance at the greasy
fried potatoes, a pork chop burned to a cinder and
the inevitable bread pudding, you just swallowed the
lump in your throat and called it a meal? After
sitting around the lobby making out a few reports
and listening to the senseless patter of a dumb-bell
in a checked suit and a pink tie, you took your little
pitcher with the broken handle, filled it at the faucet
and went up to a sea-going bed that humped up in
the middle like William S. Hart’s pet broncho?</p>

<p>Remember, Red, how you worried yourself to
sleep&mdash;sick of the whole bloomin’ mess, but determined
that if others could succeed, you could? You
got up in the morning, shaved in ice water, but
stuck out your chin and strode to the dining room?
Remember the gum-chewing waitress whom someone
had told she looked like Theda Bara, who
brought in a murky glass of water and exclaimed
in a breath, “Steakhamliver’nbacon an’ how’d you
want yer aigs?” You wouldn’t have known the coffee
if it hadn’t been in a cup, but you picked around
like an old hen and sauntered out into the lobby still
unbeaten when the fresh squirt behind the register
handed you three letters.</p>

<p>Ah, Red&mdash;how you smiled! The first one was
written in a round girlish hand and told of the good
time she was planning with you when you got back
to “headquarters.” The next one was written in an
old-fashioned hand, now a little scrawly and nervous
from age, but it carried the “mother message” of
hope and pride in the success she knew was bound
to come to “her boy.” Things weren’t so black after
all&mdash;you’d show those hard-shell merchants you
would. You were almost normal when you opened
the last letter, which from the envelope you knew
was from “the Boss.” It read&mdash;“Why don’t you send
us some orders&mdash;we didn’t send you out to write up
weather reports; we don’t pay your salary to allow
you to loll in good hotels. Unless you do better next
week, we’ll have to make a change.”</p>

<p>Bam! How’d you feel, Red? Now, honest&mdash;hasn’t
it happened to you? Did it fill you full of pep and
enthusiasm and cause you to go out and just knock
the cover off the ball? You bet it didn’t and such
things never will. That kind of letter was written
by a graduate hack-driver, not a real man manager.</p>

<p>New, Red, listen&mdash;you were made Branch Manager
because of your experience, not alone in the
product&mdash;not alone in selling, but experience in Life.
Your company thinks you have seen so much of conditions
that you know how to “help” the weaker
brother over the rough places. Teach ’em, Red, lead
’em! The only place for a driver is on the south end
of a pair of mules. A kind word here, a helpful suggestion
there, will make your men want to take off
their coats to help you, Boy, and it is the cheapest
way in the world to buy loyalty.</p>

<p>And Red, don’t spend all your time telling the
other fellow how to do it. All men are not “from
Missouri,” but the “show me” method carries a
healthier kick than volumes of sales talks.</p>

<p>You’re going to be a busy man in the new job,
Boy, but Mother and I have decided now that we’re
glad we didn’t insist on your finishing your musical
education, for some day we know you’ll be a Sales
Manager and I tell Mother that if she had her way,
you would now be playing the snare drum in a jazz
orchestra.</p>

<p>Let’s go, Boy, let’s go!</p>

Branch Manager</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I received your letter several days
ago and I have given quite some thought to the problems
you mention, because I wanted to advise you
right, if at all.</p>

<p>Note you say you are not meeting with the success
you expected to, in your present campaign and you
attribute it to several causes, among them a consumers’
hunger strike, conservative buying and lack
of effort on the part of the salesmen.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;now, of course, the Old Man may not know
as much about it as you do, but from several other
statements you made in your letter, I’m wondering
if you have really struck the <i>real reason</i>.</p>

<p>I don’t want to misjudge you, Boy, but those reasons
you give are becoming so much of a chestnut to
me&mdash;I’ve heard ’em so often that I’m pretty sure I
know their origin. I know that during the holidays&mdash;just
before Christmas&mdash;you could hear those records
being played on almost any talking machine
that you cared to listen to, but I thought surely,
with the coming of the New Year you’d forget the
“Stove League Chatter” and chase “Old Man Gloom”
out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>You know, I’m reminded of a fellow I used to
know when I wore knee breeches. Tom Foreman
was a boy who was raised in our town and who
never knew what it was to run off to go swimming,
rob a melon patch or play hookey. His folks always
dressed him nice and he was a fair student in school,
but he never batted over about a hundred and
twenty-six in the back alley league, so, of course,
there was no farewell reception tendered him by
“the gang” when his folks decided to send him away
to college.</p>

<p>Tom would come back to town for vacations
for a brief visit, but somehow or other his schooling
didn’t seem to humanize him any and each time he
came he seemed to be just a little more “uppish”
than the time before, but he was very fond of airing
his superior wisdom&mdash;sort of casting his pearls before
swine, as it were, even though we didn’t give
him any encores.</p>

<p>In this particular vicinity the only game that was
available was a few cotton-tails and an occasional
Jack Rabbit in the winter time, so that hunting had
become a lost art and the sportively inclined always
looked to some other sort of amusement.</p>

<p>We never knew exactly how it happened, but it
seemed like the boys of the Eata Bita Pie Fraternity
or whatever it was, got to talking about hunting big
game over their pipes one night and Tom suddenly
developed one of his bright ideas which had been
heretofore extinct and he took to bragging to his
fellow pie-biters about the exceptionally good hunting
that was available in the vicinity of his old home
town. Although this was in the days before prohibition,
Tom had never seriously gone in for tonsil
irrigation, yet it must have been something that
made him wax eloquent, for the first thing we knew
he had brought four embryo captains of industry
down to our town, all dressed up like a Roosevelt
African party and they announced their intention
of going out on a big hunt. Tom, of course, was too
learned to ask any of the home-guard any questions,
so they started out one spring morning in full regalia.</p>

<p>The boys caused quite a little excitement among
the fellows whose full dress uniform consisted of a
canvas cap with a coffee advertisement printed on
it, a pair of overalls and a fifty-cent shirt, but we
held that excitement in bounds until they came home
in the evening. Of course, we never knew the grewsome
details, but along about seven o’clock that
night, the hunting party returned. The total bag of
the day consisted of three ground squirrels, a hawk,
one rabbit and Lafe Benson’s tom-cat&mdash;and say, you
should have heard the profane vocabulary that those
city chaps spilled every time Tom came near them.
Of course, Tom was their host and all that and they
had to end their remarks with an apology, but to sit
around and listen you couldn’t help but gather the
idea that Tom graded a good deal lower than water
goods in fruits, when they classified him as a huntsman.</p>

<p>Now, I just mention this story in passing, because
it brings out the fact that Tom and his party hadn’t
analyzed the situation. Their intentions were good
and they had plenty of equipment, but the dumb-bell
that was leading the party, Tom, hadn’t given the
matter any thought and had no definite plan. He was
just hoping that through some miracle all the game
for miles around would just come up and plead to
be shot.</p>

<p>You know, Red, some Branch House Managers
employ similar tactics. They have the product, the
samples, the salesmen and the enthusiasm, but they
don’t analyze the possibilities&mdash;they don’t compare
the sales with the available prospects in a territory&mdash;they
allow their salesmen to take a turn-down
from a buyer who should buy big, without attempting
to make another trial. You know an amateur
hunter sometimes shoots into a flock of ducks and
wings a couple and you can sometimes stick a shotgun
under a corncrib and pull the trigger without
looking and maybe kill a rabbit, but the thinking
hunter sees the game and does his best to pick ’em
off, one by one, and generally comes in at night with
a full bag. A manager who allows his salesmen to
come out of a town that has five prospects, with two
orders and three excuses, hasn’t <i>taught</i> ’em right.</p>

<p>The hunger strike was in Ireland&mdash;Red&mdash;not in
your territory! Conservative buying can be overcome,
by not being a conservative seller&mdash;<i>SELL
MORE OF ’EM and OFTENER</i>.</p>

<p>Your salesmen’s effort will not worry you if you
don’t waste it&mdash;direct ’em, Boy, <i>ANALYZE&mdash;HAVE
A PLAN!</i></p>

being a top-notcher in your campaign, it’s going to

Advertise</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>The letter Mother and I received from you just
last night proved very interesting to me and I’ve
been thinking about it all day, for you unconsciously
wrote quite an essay on advertising.</p>

<p>From the general tone of your letter, I imagine
that you have not given any serious consideration to
the many ramifications of advertising and the true
meaning of the word, for you seem to think that
those in charge of your business have a brother-in-law
in the advertising game whom they have to support
and that therefore, they’re spending a lot of
money uselessly, that they had better put into salesmen’s
salaries.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not an advertising expert, or very much
up on the line of argument that a real advertising
man would turn loose on you under similar circumstances.
All I know about it has been learned in just
the old-fashioned school of common-sense plus what
I see around me every day and I am more than surprised
to think that a red-headed scamp with horn-rimmed
goggles couldn’t see certain signs as clearly
as I do.</p>

<p>You seem to have the idea that because your line
of goods is the finest thing in cans on the market,
and has been so for fifty years, that the world and
some parts of Missouri know it, never will forget it
and chant it as an ode before breakfast every morning
and that therefore, the constant advertising that
your company keeps up is all unnecessary. I further
gather that you think the glib tongues of yourself
and salesmen, plus the glibness of your predecessors
are entirely responsible for the business you
enjoy.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not denying for an instant the insistent
urge of the contents of the can on the appetite of
the consumers or the efforts&mdash;<i>Real Sales Efforts</i>&mdash;of
the hard-hitting salesmen on your company’s payroll,
both now and in the by-gone days, but I would
like you to appreciate that those things were nothing
more than ADVERTISING and the other kind
of advertising that you are talking about is but another
form that augments the other and that all of
it working together has been able to produce this
present result and to attempt to minimize the effect
of any of it is as foolish as the argument of the
backwoods hill billy who argued against giving his
son an education because he had never had one.</p>

<p>Now, Red, you’ve traveled some and still do and I
wonder if you ever got acquainted with that black
bound book with the red edges that lies on the table
in most hotel rooms. On the back of the book is a
picture of a water-pitcher and underneath it says
something about being placed there by the Gideon
Society and if you ever looked in it, you’d find it was
that (almost obsolete to some salesmen) gem of literature
known as The Holy Bible. No, I’m not starting
to preach&mdash;fact is, preachers are not the only
ones who read the Bible. I’ll admit that it isn’t
always as lively reading as Ade or Ibanez, but
strange as it may seem to you, you heathen, this
Book is not only found in hotel rooms, but on the
reading desks of our best citizens&mdash;and there’s a
reason.</p>

<p>You know, Red, the Bible isn’t an old moth-eaten
account of prehistoric people, as some might think,
but it really contains some of the best business
stories that you can pick up.</p>

<p>Speaking again of advertising, if you’ll just open
up that Book the next time you’re in a hotel room, or
can borrow one from the neighbors, turn to the latter
part of the Book of Genesis and begin to read
about Joseph. For fear you will not get to your
hotel room from the pool hall soon enough, or your
own Bible is in the trunk in the storeroom, I’ll just
tell you about it.</p>

<p>It seems that this fellow Joseph was kind of a
hard luck individual in the early days and he got off
on the wrong foot with his brethren and was sold
into bondage and carried down into Egypt. He
sparred around in Egypt for several years, just like
lots of others do in these days, without being taken
very seriously&mdash;sort of working the retail trade, as
it were, when by some clever bit of personal advertising,
like stepping on a fellow’s foot or something,
he got acquainted with Pharaoh, who was the Woodrow
Wilson of the party in power at that time. It
seems that Pharaoh had some kind of a dream (this
same thing still happens you know) and Joe had
the good Fortune to be allowed to interpret it. He
predicted that there would be a famine in the land
following several years of plenty and he sold the
idea to Pharaoh so well that Pharaoh set up a Food
Administration and appointed Joseph as the Herbert
Hoover of it and he immediately started a
corner on the grain market.</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short&mdash;Joe had the
right “dope” and just as he predicted there was a
famine fell upon the land, but due to Joseph’s foresight,
which was unhampered by politicians, there
was plenty of food for all and Joe became a great
man. Joseph’s brothers who had mistreated him
when he wore knee pants, came down to see him and
brought Dad along and they were quite surprised to
find him the Big Noise in Egypt, but they were
hungry.</p>

<p>Now, Joe had been raised right&mdash;was a decent
sort of chap and all that, so he welcomed them and
persuaded ’em to go back and bring the rest of the
“gang.” They did so and the first thing they knew
Egypt looked like Coney Island on Sunday afternoon&mdash;just
full of Jews, and the people treated them
fine because they were Joseph’s relatives.</p>

<p>Then, if you’ll skip on to the first few verses in
Exodus, you’ll find a sentence that speaks volumes.
It says “And there arose a new king in the land who
knew not Joseph.” Now, get that Red&mdash;“There arose
a new king in the land who knew not Joseph.” What
can be plainer than that? Did you ever hear a better
advertising argument? You see, Joseph got to thinking
just like you talk&mdash;he thought he didn’t need
ADVERTISING.</p>

<p>The rest of the story goes on to tell how the Jews
fell in popular favor&mdash;they failed to keep their
name, their merits and their accomplishments
before the people and a new king arose who knew
not Joseph.</p>

<p>Now I only tell you this story in passing and tell
it in the language I do because it’s the only language
you seem to understand. There are lots of other good
stories in the Bible&mdash;dig ’em out Red&mdash;they’re good
for you.</p>

<p>Boy, listen! Advertising doesn’t mean just so
much printer’s ink in the newspapers, or magazines.
That’s the most familiar form and it’s necessary and
produces big, but there are other kinds. You know
the majority of your trade never knew the founders
of your company personally. When they think of
your company they think of you. You’re the point
of contact. What kind of an advertisement are you
for the firm? Did you ever think of the responsibility
you are carrying as a manager of your company?
Do you know that every move, every letter you
write, every position you take means that you are
portraying your company to someone?</p>

<p>In business a new king arises in the land every
day. There’s a new retail grocer&mdash;a new jobber&mdash;or
jobber’s buyer on a thousand corners. They know
not Joseph&mdash;regardless of how good your product
is, or how long you’ve been on the territory, IT
TAKES ADVERTISING TO PUT YOU ACROSS
IN A BIG WAY.</p>

<p>I’m going to bed, Red, hoping I haven’t bored
you. Just remember that the Old Man is always
hoping that your personal label means as much as
the label on your company’s can&mdash;if it does&mdash;ADVERTISE.</p>

Knickers and Put on Long Pants</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother just finished reading your last letter aloud
to me and while I know my quick reply will sort of
shock you, I cannot help but unload a few pet ideas
I have along the lines suggested in your letter.</p>

<p>If the proverbial innocent bystander, or casual observer
were to pick up your letter in the street and
would take it seriously (which I don’t) he’d certainly
pick you up as hopeless, for the whole wail of your
letter, in criticising the way the home office is handling
you in particular and the sales organization in
general, reminds me so much of the kind and constructive
verbal barrage that a Republican Senator
lays down every time a Democratic colleague intimates
in public that his party won the World War.</p>

<p>A little over a week ago, I found time hanging a
little heavily on my hands so I thought I’d take a
run out to the Stock Yards and visit a little in your
company’s office. I don’t know why I did it&mdash;guess it
was a little touch of parental pride, or sentiment that
must have come over me and I thought I’d go out
and let ’em kid me along about that red-headed son
of mine. Anyway, knowing them so well out there, I
thought I’d enjoy the trip and I wasn’t disappointed.
Things have changed quite a little since my time, but
if I’m any judge they haven’t forgotten the Old
Man’s admonition to “<i>keep up the quality</i>” not only
in the product, but also in the caliber of the men
who are running the business from the “boss” himself,
clear down to the office boy.</p>

<p>Then I sat down at the boss’ desk and just as
I expected he had some very nice things to say about
you which, of course, were hard to take. After
talking to him as long as I thought I dared, I went
over and sat down at the desk where all the General
Sales Department mail was being sorted and I summoned
up enough courage to ask to see the open
files they had with you. Don’t know why I did it&mdash;guess
it was just because I was curious to see how
well you handled things and I suppose they thought
they’d gratify an old man’s whim by allowing it&mdash;anyway,
they handed me a big bunch of correspondence
and I went over and sat down in one of the
private offices so I could digest it.</p>

<p>The first letter I picked up from the pile ran
something like this, “Attached please find a letter
from Salesman Hooiszis, asking that we purchase
an automobile. What do you want to do with
it?” And, as I expected, the salesman’s letter was
typical of what could be expected from your letter.
It merely said he “thought” he could get more business
working with an automobile than he could by
walking&mdash;no data&mdash;no estimates&mdash;no logical reasons,
in fact no nothing on which anyone could base an
intelligent opinion as to whether the request was
justified.</p>

<p>Then I picked up another one of your letters that
ran something like this, “Salesman I. M. Whatshisname
was sick all of last week. Please advise if I
shall pay him or not.” A flat statement with no
recommendation as to what action you, as a Manager,
would like taken.</p>

<p>Then I picked up a third letter that ran a good deal
like this, “We have on hand twenty-eight Christmas
Boxes which we have been unable to sell. No doubt
some of the other houses have a market for them.
Will you not please give us disposition.”</p>

<p>By the time I got through with that, Red, I’ll
confess I had mingled emotions. I didn’t know
whether to laugh or cry. I wondered if they were
framing up on me to give my pride a jolt and I
looked out the door at the two men who handled
those letters&mdash;noticed the bald spots on their heads,
the wrinkles beginning to show around their eyes
and the gray commencing to come around the
temples and, Red&mdash;on the level, Boy, I didn’t wonder.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but think of the story of the long
suffering Job or how the songs and stories of the
centuries have told of the long suffering patience
of Mother Love and I’ll confess I couldn’t figure it
out, for those fellows didn’t have the appearance of
the Job I’d had described to me, nor did they resemble
doting mammas, so I gathered up the bunch
of letters, red in the face I’ll admit, and went out and
asked one of ’em how in the double-jointed, concentrated
essence of modern profanity they managed to
reconcile their keeping you on the payroll after writing
such letters as those first three. He looked at
’em, scratched his bald spot, smiled&mdash;think of it,
Red, (you red-headed pepper-box) smiled when I
was all ready for the thirty-second degree of
apoplexy and said, “Well, Dad, the only trouble with
you is that you quit after reading the first three.”
Then he took up the rest, one by one, and showed
me stuff that gradually brought me down to earth.</p>

<p>He showed me a dozen along the same line and
ended up by saying, “You see, Dad, Red is a pretty
good boy after all&mdash;it wasn’t very long ago that he
was made Manager and he sometimes overlooks the
fact that more is now expected of him and we’ll admit
that some of his letters do smack of the kindergarten,
but he’s sensible and we’re trying to teach
him that we employ Managers to come to us <i>with</i> a
decision or recommendation, not <i>for</i> one; something
that we can approve or show him why it is impractical.
In other words, to <i>think for us</i>, not we for
him. And again, we are trying to pound through
that red pate of his that stock he has is <i>his</i> responsibility&mdash;must
be moved in his territory&mdash;not shipped
to a more aggressive brother Manager.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Dad, Red has his faults, but
he’ll grow up.”</p>

<p>So I left, Red, feeling that your company was
a little more tolerant than I would be and I guess
after all, I’ll have to take some of the blame for
your last letter, in that you’re my son, but when I
read that letter of yours&mdash;full of criticism, but
strangely minus suggestions&mdash;I couldn’t help mutter,
“Take off the rompers, Boy, take ’em off&mdash;get on the
long pants&mdash;you’re a big boy now.”</p>

<p>Just remember&mdash;anyone can criticize, but the boy
with the sensible suggestion for improvement and
the definite logical recommendation, doesn’t have to
sit on the bench when they play the World’s Series.</p>

<p>Goodnight Red&mdash;think it over.</p>

Counsel</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Your last letter made me happier than I can begin
to tell you. In it you related some of your problems
and really <i>asked</i> advice. I was beginning to think
you are getting “fed up” on my unsolicited counsel
but feel complimented to know you now want more
of it.</p>

<p>But, leaving the personal side out of it, you know,
Red, the smart man is the one who collects ideas
from every one he meets, separates the wheat from
the chaff and then capitalizes them, and it’s a sincere
pleasure for me to know that you’ve at last arrived
at the age when you are big enough to admit that
when brains were passed around you didn’t get all
of ’em.</p>

<p>So you’re wondering what’s the matter with your
salesmen, eh? They don’t seem to take things seriously
and worry whether they get business or not&mdash;always
looking forward to pay-day and that’s all&mdash;eh,
what? All right&mdash;your description of their
attitude is so good that I believe I know just where
the trouble is.</p>

<p>I suppose you were too young at the time to get the
lesson, but, Red, your case reminds me of something
that used to happen regularly when you were a little
boy. Do you remember years ago when you used to
have that brindle pup? He wasn’t much to look at&mdash;had
no pedigree, or anything, but was just plain dog&mdash;the
kind whose only excuse for living was that he
was a playmate of a freckle-faced, red-headed boy.
Well, anyway, the little girl next door had a cat for
a pet, if you’ll remember. Similarly to the dog, the
cat hadn’t taken any blue ribbons and about the only
thing she did worth mentioning now, at least, was
to notify the family that claimed her, ever so often,
that she was the proud mother of a mess, and I say
it advisedly, Red, a mess of kittens.</p>

<p>But the Boss of the house didn’t appreciate her
being so prolific&mdash;not being as interested in cat
farms as our old friend Charlie Emery. So ever so
often, while you and the neighbor girl were out to a
toddle party, her father and myself would sneak
down in their basement, ostensibly to look over the
last sad remnants of his private stock (which is
speaking in an unknown tongue to you now), but
primarily to increase the mortality list of the cat
specie by holding each kitten in the bottom of a pail
of water until eight of their proverbial nine lives
had taken flight for cat heaven.</p>

<p>Now, Spud, your pup and Puss, the mother cat,
were never what you might call affinities. Even
though the two families with whom they were living
were always close friends, the same measure of respect
and esteem was not shared by Spud and Puss.
As a result, every time Spud would spy Puss in the
backyard he’d let out a mongrel yelp and start for
her with the obvious intention of annihilating her.</p>

<p>Now the thing that used to impress me about this
almost daily scene was that when Puss didn’t have
any kittens&mdash;no family responsibilities, as it were&mdash;when
Spud rushed for her she’d turn tail and do a
double-quick for the nearest tree, registering all the
fear and retiring qualities that we come to expect in
the female of the species.</p>

<p>But when Puss had kittens, still undrowned, particularly
when she was enjoying a siesta in their
presence, Spud could make his flying start with all
the gusto and bluff that is common to cur tactics,
but when he arrived at the point of contact Puss
would bow her back, never budge an inch and show
all the courage of the early Spartans. The result, of
course, was that on such occasions the fun was all
out of the game for Spud and he was clearly “sold”
on the proposition that Puss could not be bluffed,
and he’d beat a hasty retreat before getting within
paw-length of the confident Puss.</p>

<p>Now, Red, that’s all there is to the story, except
the <i>moral</i>. Just consider the salient points. Same
dog, same cat, same backyard, but different performance.
Why, Red, why? Ah!&mdash;you’ve got it, I
know. <i>Inspiration</i>&mdash;that’s it&mdash;that’s the word. Puss
with kittens had an inspiration that Puss without
them didn’t have.</p>

<p>Now, Boy, take this lesson right home with you
and apply it to your own problem. What your salesmen
lack is <i>inspiration</i>, and you’re the little doctor
with the hypodermic to give it to ’em. Of course, it
doesn’t apply literally, even though some people do
claim that the man with the big family has as many
more reasons as he has mouths to feed, why he
should make a success, but&mdash;I don’t mean it that
way, Red&mdash;I don’t mean it that way. You must
teach your men to <i>speak</i> and <i>feel</i> about <i>your company
as</i> “We,” not as “the house.”</p>

<p>Any man with a single spark of ambition should
look forward to an eventual goal, considerably farther
than the weekly pay-check. His permanency on
their payroll and the advancement he should hope
to merit, depends entirely upon the combined efforts
of the company family. His success is their success,
and without favorable results neither he, nor they,
can prosper.</p>

<p><i>Teach ’em, Red&mdash;show ’em their responsibility!</i>
Fire their minds and hearts with the fact that
they’re not working for the company&mdash;bless your
heart, Boy, they <i>are</i> the company to all intent and
purpose on their territory, and either their lackadaisical
or their aggressive, businesslike demeanor
and actions will be interpreted by their trade exactly
as they appear and the company will be so reflected.
And when you tell ’em, Red, be sure that the <i>enthusiasm</i>
you have, which as you know, is the fuse
that ignites <i>opportunity</i>, is showing in your eyes,
your face and is reflected from your heart. <i>Enthusiasm&mdash;Inspiration.</i>
Ah! Red, it’s contagious&mdash;show
’em how proud you are to say “<i>We</i>”&mdash;show ’em that
it’s a privilege to be a part of an organization that
holds the place it does in the firmament of a big
business. <i>Sell ’em the company idea first</i>&mdash;then sell
’em the line.</p>

<p>After that, Red, if I’m not mistaken, you’ll have
’em sitting on the edge of the chair, rarin’ to go,
filled with the kind of red-blooded courage that has
made American ideas and American ideals a
synonym for accomplishment.</p>

<p>If you sell your salesmen all that, Old Top, and
keep ’em sold by your living example, I don’t think
you’ll have to worry about the results they turn in.
If that doesn’t work, then the Old Man’s experience
with human nature is a failure and he’ll be disappointed
in his own judgment and the ability of his
fire-brand son.</p>

<p>Keep me posted&mdash;I like it.</p>

Pet “Peeve”</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I have a lot of fun before we open
each of your letters, speculating on whether or not
you’re going to tell us of some unusual accomplishment,
or air a pet peeve. So far, the peeves you’ve
aired have been so imaginary that we have enjoyed
them just as much as your successes, so don’t harbor
the thought that we’d attempt to discourage your
letter-writing style for a moment. In fact, Mother
thinks that my chief enjoyment these days is giving
you advice in answer to the problems you mention
and I guess she’s not so far off, at that&mdash;Mother
never is, you know.</p>

<p>So you’re all “het up” and about ready to quit
over the fact that the boss has put a “District Manager”
or “General Man” over you, eh? You’re not
going to stand for all this “supervision;” if you’re
not capable of running your branch and working
direct with Chicago, you want to know it&mdash;eh? And
especially, do you want ’em to know that you’re
every bit as capable as the fellow they picked out as
your so-called superior&mdash;and just where do they get
all these new-fangled notions about supervision. Of
course, Mr. So and So is a nice fellow personally, but
you just don’t intend to be bossed by anyone except
the General Sales Manager himself and this and that,
and this and that, and this and that!!! Whew! Gee!
but our cat’s got a long tail.</p>

<p>You know, Red, really you furnish me a lot of
amusement. All I have to do to thoroughly enjoy
myself after reading a letter like yours is to light up
an old jimmy-pipe, get in the old arm chair, close my
eyes and live over again the old days when you were
a little shaver about nine years old. Whenever that
white-headed brother of yours would get into a game
of marbles or a checker game with you and Junior
would begin to get a little the best of you, you’d
throw one of those red-headed, temperamental fits
of yours, kick over the checker-board, throw away
your marbles, toss that vermillion mane in the air,
chew up a couple of lead pencils and swear by all the
by-laws of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer that
you’d be tetotally dod-buttered and ding-busted if
you’d ever play a game with him again.</p>

<p>The amusing part about it, Red, was that it was
only a brain storm that I used to attribute to your
general fiery disposition, for in less than five minutes
you’d forgotten all the vindictive utterances
and were playing with the brother again just as
sweet and happy as you please.</p>

<p>Yes, it was funny, Boy, and I used to get many a
good laugh, but Red, when you put one of ’em on
paper at your age, I’ll have to admit the only way I
get a laugh is to try to think of you as a kid. As a
kid, it was truly laughable, but for a fellow as big
and as old as you are now&mdash;LONG PANTS&mdash;hair on
your upper lip and wearing a vest n’everything&mdash;on
the level Red, you’re as funny as an epileptic fit&mdash;you’re
pitiful!</p>

<p>Now listen, Old Top, before you make up your
mind to walk out and leave the company lying on
its back gasping&mdash;just sit down a minute and let’s
talk this over. You’ve got all the confidence in the
world in the “Big Boss” haven’t you? You think
pretty well of his judgment and wouldn’t put yours
up as being superior to it for a minute, now would
you? Of course not! Now just let this thought ooze
into that corrugated cast-iron brain of yours&mdash;your
company isn’t running a peanut stand any more&mdash;they
might have been small enough one day when
the Boss himself could put up the window-shades
and sweep out the office every night, but that time
has passed, Boy, that day is gone.</p>

<p>Admitting that, doesn’t it occur to you that the
Boss has to have a little help in running the business?
No one ever made a success of any business if
he didn’t attend to it; if he didn’t know what was
going on all the time. You’d think anyone a lunatic
who expected you to sell all the goods handled
through your branch, deliver them yourself and do
all the billing. You’d say it just couldn’t be done,
which is true and then you’d go on and sketch how
you’d organize a force to do all of it with your help,
of course, and you’d know what’s going on every
minute.</p>

<p>All right&mdash;now doesn’t it dawn on you that you
are expecting the Big Boss to be as ridiculous as the
suggestion about your doing all the work in your
branch, when you voice those one-quarter of one
per cent sentiments, criticising him for calling in
help to handle a far more complex problem than
your little unit?</p>

<p>The General Sales Manager of a company like
yours, which does business in all parts of the world,
has a pretty big task cut out for him. You may be a
conscientious, intelligent, hard-working manager,
but you’re human, Red, and being human, you’re not
always one hundred per cent right and it’s his job
to know all about you and the way you’re handling
your business, all the time. You’re not foolish enough
to think he can keep in as close touch as would be
necessary to know all these things, with scores of
branches, are you? Of course not! Well, all right
then, just how is he going to do it? You know the
answer just as well as I do&mdash;so granting that help is
necessary and that he has to have someone to be his
“eyes” in the field&mdash;who’s going to do it and what
would YOU call the position? The answer is obvious&mdash;he
must have “District Managers” and if you
were the Boss just who would you pick as a District
Manager? I know just what you’re going to say, so
I’ll say it first. Of course, he could pick the oldest
managers on the force&mdash;and their experience would
make good District Managers of them&mdash;mind you,
but that would be wishing an awful hard job on
those old fellows who deserve to take it easier than
they could on a District Manager’s job. The older
managers have arrived at a place in life where they
don’t want to spend fifteen nights out of thirty on a
Pullman and you cannot blame ’em.</p>

<p>The District Manager’s title may sound awfully
nice, but it’s no flowery bed of ease, Red, believe me.
All right then, if that’s impractical, what is the answer?
I’ll tell you&mdash;they pick men who have had a
broad experience in the game; men who have had
good reputations as good housekeepers; men who
know how to analyze branch house expense as well
as sales results; men who are so constituted that
they can give REAL HELP to a manager who is
intelligent enough to use the experience and advice
that is thus afforded. It’s no reflection against your
intelligence and ability to have one of ’em over you&mdash;why
bless your old red-headed soul, the only man
in this life who don’t need supervision, that I know
of, is a wooden Indian in front of a cigar store. He’s
bolted down&mdash;no brains&mdash;just a wooden man! Why
even the officers of a company have supervision in
the board of directors and back of the board are the
stockholders, and boy, they’re some supervisors.</p>

<p>And Red, don’t let anyone of human intelligence
overhear you question the ability of the man supervising&mdash;don’t
you know when you do that, you’re
questioning the judgment of the Big Boss himself
and Boy, you mustn’t do that because you’re old
enough to know better. Just put this in your pipe,
Old Top, anybody nowadays who’s holding a job that
requires ability, has got it tucked away around his
system some place, I’ll admit that sometimes it’s
pretty hard for a youngster to see, but it’s there,
Boy, it’s there. Some day you’ll be a District Manager
if you’ll just quit standing on your own foot.</p>

<p>After thinking over what I’ve said, if you still
feel like you did when you wrote your letter, go
ahead and send in your resignation&mdash;they’ll accept
it and not pass any dividends either. I’m hoping
however, that your letter was just a recurrence of
one of your childish temperamental fits and if so,
I’ll laugh at it just like I used to. If not, I suppose
I’ll have to go down and try and find a job for you
driving a hack, so please don’t make it hard for</p>

Dad Out on Matrimony</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I have had several executive sessions
since receiving your last letter, and you can well imagine
that I’ve received a lot of “advice” from her
as to just how to answer it, but it’s no use&mdash;the
Good Lord so constituted me that I have to “speak
right out in meeting” if at all, so if I’m going to
advise you along the line you requested, I’ve just got
to tell you how I feel about it without reservation,
so here goes!</p>

<p>You didn’t tell us much in your letter about how
far this affair of yours had gone and it makes it a
little difficult on that account. You talk like there’s
nothing “serious” yet and that you’re just wondering
about certain “features” of Life’s greatest adventure.
Well, I hope you’re not kidding the “old
man,” for I’m too old a bird to know that if you’re
all through with the overture, prologue and the medley
of popular airs between the first and second act,
that it’s too late for me to try and break up the
party, so if you’re telling me the truth, the few
words of advice I’ll give may fall on fertile ground,
but if not, Boy, it may sting a little, but anyway,
you’ve brought it on yourself, as Delilah remarked
to Sampson when he started the rough house in the
Temple.</p>

<p>I have half a notion to send your letter back to
you just to show you how little you really told us
about Her. About all I’ve been able to gather, after
reading your letter about five times, is that she’s
about the finest thing in petticoats that ever wielded
a lipstick; comes from “an awfully old and respected
family;” is the only child; has been raised a pet; is
beautiful and accomplished (presume you mean by
that, she can dress herself with the assistance of a
couple of maids) and her “old man” has oodles of
money. Humph! somehow that description don’t
thrill me a bit!</p>

<p>Now, Red, before you begin to get red above the
collar-band, just let me say in passing that I don’t
mean anything personal about the girl at all&mdash;she
cannot help it because she’s that way, and there’s
just a chance that I’ve got her all wrong. No doubt
she’s all you said about her and then some, but if
she is, I’m just wondering if you accidentally picked
up a white chip on the floor, or just how you came to
get a hand in the game?</p>

<p>Not that there’s anything about it that isn’t good
enough for anyone of that description&mdash;no&mdash;far be
it from me, Red, to run down the quality of your
personal line, but your description doesn’t mean anything
to a fellow who has lived long enough to know
that there’s something more to this life than moonlight
and honeysuckle. I can almost hear you say
that the “old man” is hard-boiled, maybe I am, but
there’s a practical side to this matrimonial game
and it is a pretty good thing to consider seriously
before you go into the musical comedy features.</p>

<p>Now let’s discuss this thing from a sensible standpoint.
This “old and respected family” business is a
nice thing, Red, but it will not add a single item to
the order you get from the wholesale grocer around
the corner: What does she know about sewing buttons
on a union suit so you will not have to use up a
whole card of safety pins? I’ve found that knowledge
fairly essential in cold weather.</p>

<p>She’s an “only child”&mdash;a “pet,” eh? Well, that’s
fine, Red. It’s nice to know that you will not have a
couple of “old maid” sisters-in-law to help you ride
range and boss the outfit, but does she show any
signs of being ambitious enough to get up at 6:30
A. M. and cook breakfast for you, or do you think
you’d have to go around to the Greasy Greek’s for
your coffee and? Maybe that thought hasn’t occurred
to you, especially when standing under a
Southern Moon when the Zephyrs waft the odor of
the Lilacs; but, Boy, the Zephyrs should some day
waft the odor of a few pieces of bacon with you on
the receiving end in your own dining room, and
you’ll appreciate that more and more as your
pompadour recedes.</p>

<p>I like that part of your description where you say
she’s beautiful and accomplished. That means a
lot, Boy, but am wondering if you mean it the way
I’d like to believe. God never made anything more
beautiful than a good woman. She’s His Masterpiece,
all right&mdash;there’s no doubt about that, but
some folks’ idea of beauty is different from mine.
The cleverest word painter who ever wrote a massage
cream ad, couldn’t commence to picture that
beauty&mdash;that beggars description&mdash;that rapturous
smile that is born of the very whispering of angels
which lights a mother’s face when she hears the first
cry of her new-born babe. Beauty&mdash;why, Boy&mdash;the
symmetry or form and feature of a Venus pales into
insignificance beside it, and the funny thing about it
is no one woman, or type, has a corner on it. Of
course, you’ve never dreamed of that example, but
it’s coming to you, Boy, it’s coming to you.</p>

<p>And “accomplished”&mdash;well, what do you mean by
that? Has she taken a post-graduate course in Victrola
lessons, can toddle and sing in Society’s amateur
“Follies,” or do you mean you think she
could some day referee a bout between a couple of
lusty-lunged seven and ten-year-old boys, croon a
lullaby to a nursing baby and keep the Sunday roast
from burning, all at the same time? I’ll say you
want to get one that’s “accomplished,” but it’s a
damsite more important to visualize just what they
could “accomplish” later, than what has gone
before.</p>

<p>Note you say “her old man has oodles of money,”
but you forgot to mention whether he was a burglar,
a politician, or a flat owner&mdash;not that there’s very
much difference, but I was sort of curious. Anyway,
as I see it, that’s the least important thing in
your description. The “old man” may be a decent
sort, after all, and may have got it by marriage or
from one of Ryan’s tips on the stock market, so it
may not be his fault. At least, I don’t see how
that’s going to affect you in the least. I know you
well enough to know, Red, that you’ll never become
one of those parasites who, on account of having
money in the family, find their most arduous duty
the daily airing of a poodle dog on a string&mdash;neither
can I picture you under any circumstances paying
your cigarette bills with other than the coin you had
personally earned, so I’m not going to comment on
that feature.</p>

<p>Now listen, Red, I expect you think that I’ve been
pretty caustic in the foregoing, and in order to let
you win an argument I’ll agree; but, Boy, this marriage
thing is a more serious problem than you think
it is. I appreciate that there are a great many requisites
to look for in a wife that I haven’t enumerated
above. It goes without saying that you will
choose eventually a girl fully worthy of you in intelligence,
beauty, lineage and what not, but I do
want you to come down out of the clouds&mdash;realize
that there’s something more to it than love and
kisses and a cottage.</p>

<p>Remember the girl you choose will sit across the
table from you for thousands of dinners. She may
look awfully good in a party dress, but will she show
up as well in a Mother Hubbard with her hair in
curl papers? She may make an exquisite Welsh
rarebit, but can she brew a real cup of coffee? She
may be charming in the receiving line at an afternoon
function, but can she build a satisfactory pair
of rompers?</p>

<p>I’ve sort of born down on one feature, Red&mdash;I’ve
done so advisedly, because in my opinion the deciding
question, after all is said and done, is, “What
kind of a mother will she make for my children?”
If you can honestly answer that question and give
a favorable one, the rest will take care of themselves,
Boy&mdash;the rest will take care of themselves.</p>

<p>And, after reading this, Red, if the idea should
come to you that maybe the “old man” don’t know
what he’s talking about, just stop a minute&mdash;pause,
Boy, and consider that it took some little picker to
choose one who has come up to every one of these
qualifications&mdash;your Mother! and the other half of
the sketch knows that he’ll always be proud to sign
himself</p>

</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I have had quite a discussion tonight
about your last letter and we’ve just about come to
the conclusion that you’re eating too much rooster
meat, or something else with similar effect, for your
last letter certainly shows that you’re getting
“cocky.” Of course, you may have reason to be, on
account of something you’re holding back. Maybe
Mother and I don’t quite appreciate just how important
you really are, but anyway the local cigar man
hasn’t displayed any cigar boxes with your pictures
on ’em yet, so we’re forced to assume that you’re
just feeling your oats a bit.</p>

<p>I notice that you’ve arrived at the place where you
complain quite a little about the damphool things the
Chicago office writes you about and the asininity of
some of their requests and plans. It seems they’ve
insulted your intelligence by questioning some of
your moves and that they certainly have had enough
experience with you to know that you wouldn’t do
anything but one way, which, of course, is the right
way, and you’re getting tired of being bothered with
so many bunglers and policies.</p>

<p>Now, Red, if you think that your otherwise good
letter is going to kindle a single spark of sympathy
in the Old Man, you’re just as mistaken as if you’d
torn your shirt.</p>

<p>The first thing I wonder about is, just how do you
get that way? I suppose you’ve been working pretty
hard, your digestion is bad, or else you’ve quit smoking
or something else has turned up to change the
even alto of your way, because the symptoms you
are displaying are not at all new to me, or anyone
else who has gotten over the college yell days of
business life. No&mdash;we’ve all gone thru it, Boy, we’ve
all gone thru it, and the only question in my mind in
your case is, will it turn out to be only baby rash, or
a genuine case of the measles?</p>

<p>You know, ever since Hector was a pup, pretty
nearly every five-fingered snoozer has sometime or
other in his life arrived at a place where he thought
everything he did was one hundred per cent right
and he formed a hundred and five proof pity for the
poor unfortunate numskulls who didn’t agree with
him. It’s a sort of childhood disease that has to be
gone thru, like mumps, chicken-pox or hog cholera.
The majority of the victims recover after a very
brief illness and there have been but few cases where
it actually killed the victim. However, there are
numerous cases on record where it has necessitated
an operation to remove the ego and quite a few instances
where it has left the victim in such shape
that they had to seek out-door employment like ringing
up fares on the back platform of a street car, or
riding on top of a hansom cab.</p>

<p>Now Mother and I are not very much concerned
in your case, because we know you have a rugged
constitution that will pull you thru the crisis, but
we’re wondering if it wouldn’t do you a little good
to sort of hold up the mirror and let you see just
how ludicrous you look to the rest of the world
while you’re suffering from this malady. Remember
how funny you looked when you had the mumps
and when you were all broken out with Liberty
measles? Well, Boy, if that brought the smiles of
the onlookers, your present indisposition makes ’em
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Now listen, Red, your entire trouble can be diagnosed
as just a perverted point of view and every
time I use that expression I am reminded of a call
I once made at a hospital when the nurse and the
doctor called me in to get my first peep at a little
squirming mite of humanity that afterwards learned
to call me Dad. In my enthusiasm and paternal
pride, I exclaimed “Some girl” but the doctor just
shook his head and said, “No, you’re mistaken&mdash;a
boy.” Now Red, I wasn’t exactly an idiot. I knew
more or less about babies and all that, but the reason
the doctor and I didn’t agree was purely point
of view. He knew, whereas I was only jumping at
conclusions.</p>

<p>But to go back to your symptoms. Of course, I
know you’re going to tell me where you can point
out where you were asked by Chicago to furnish
information, or do something that you knew wasn’t
what they wanted&mdash;was nonsensical, etc., and I’ll
agree with you&mdash;now&mdash;think a minute! Chicago
don’t claim to be above errors, mistakes and cases
of bad judgment. Of course not, and do you know
why they make no such claims? Well, I’ll tell you.
It’s because they’ve gone thru and gotten over the
same illness you have. They know as long as they
are dealing with the human equation, errors will
creep in, but haven’t you noticed, now be honest Red,
that they don’t jump at conclusions like you do and
doesn’t it occur to you that if they have found clairvoyance
impractical as compared to cold fact, that
they will naturally ask more questions, demand
clearer explanations and expect you to conduct
your end in a more self-explanatory fashion than
otherwise?</p>

<p>The trouble with you, Old Top, is that when you
get a letter from Chicago requesting a little, simple
thing and especially if they don’t go to the trouble
to explain every reason why they want it, which
they shouldn’t have to do, you immediately begin to
hunt for holes in it. Instead of thinking along the
lines of how quick you can comply, you begin to
wonder if there’s a hidden meaning in it; if they
couldn’t get the same thing some other place, etc.,
and you burn up ten times as much energy and
write more letters trying not to do what is wanted
than you would if you’d just go about and do it.</p>

<p>You know, Red, when you were a little fellow you
had the same symptoms, but I thought you’d outgrow
’em. When you were about nine years old and
would do something that I thought you should be
disciplined for slightly, I would frequently order you
to go over and sit down in a certain chair. After
so much hesitation you’d start, but you’d take a
circuitous route, knock over the piano bench, kick
the cat and eventually, if I kept after you, you’d
arrive at the chair designated, but afterward, when
in lower mathematics you learned the axiom that
the shortest distance between two given points was
a straight line, I thought you had gotten over it, but
I guess not&mdash;eh, what?</p>

<p>Now to make you feel a little better, I’ll admit
that men higher up than you often get the wrong
point of view and I’ll illustrate. One time information
came to the home office that a certain competitor
was putting a special pack on the market in a
certain large city, but not letting it be known that it
was special by packing it under the same label that
they were using all over the country. Naturally,
this was important and needed quick investigation.
Chicago wired their manager in that city to pick up
some samples of that brand and send in immediately.</p>

<p>Chicago didn’t go to the trouble to explain their
reasons&mdash;it wasn’t necessary and long telegrams
cost money. A few days later they received a letter
from this manager which read something like this:
“I received your wire asking me to send you samples
of Blank’s Beans. I cannot understand why you
should bother me with a request of this kind when
all you’d have to do would be to go into any store in
Chicago and buy the same thing, therefore, I am
not complying with your request.” He even went so
far as to send a copy to the Boss expiating on the
asininity of the dumb-bell making such a request
and, of course, expecting quite a pat on the back for
his forethought.</p>

<p>I guess I don’t need to finish the story; you can
imagine the Golden Text that the Boss thought of
after reading the letter, particularly considering
that it was his suggestion in the first place.</p>

<p>Now Red, this means only one thing&mdash;if you’re
loyal (and you are) don’t look for the holes in every
proposition that’s put up to you until you arrive at
a position where your chief duties are to look for
those holes. As long as you’re working under someone
else, give your superior the benefit of the doubt.
He may make some mistakes, but don’t be trying to
read his mind. Don’t get cynical&mdash;give the other fellow
credit for having a reason for asking what he
does. Get out your old yellow copy of Elbert Hubbard’s
preachment “The Message to Garcia” and
note how that fellow, when given a task, didn’t look
for the holes in it, or question the motive, but went
ahead and did it.</p>

<p>There’s a lesson in it for you, Boy&mdash;get it!</p>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I arrived home without mishap and
she said I should write you at once and let you know
that we arrived safely and to tell you again how
much we appreciated the good time that you showed
us on our visit.</p>

<p>Am mighty glad I went to the office with you Saturday
and attended your meeting with your salesmen.
You were so busy just about the time I had to
run away to make my train that I didn’t get to tell
you several little points that I picked up, but I guess
I can tell you just as well in this letter.</p>

<p>You probably noticed that I made it my business
to sort of “mill” around with your various men and
engage them in conversation. I want to congratulate
you on the class of men you have gotten together.
They’re a credit to you, Boy, and with that bunch
of enthusiastic live-wires, I don’t think you need to
worry a bit about your results just as long as you
direct them properly.</p>

<p>There was one thing that struck me very forcibly
as I talked to your various salesmen. Every one of
them had a great big territory and they freely admitted
that they weren’t calling on all their prospects;
said they didn’t have time and they admitted
that they picked out the best and biggest prospects
where they were pretty sure to land an order and
then rushed on to another town and went through
the same performance.</p>

<p>Now, Red, I don’t blame your men for that condition&mdash;I
think they are sincere in thinking they are
doing just right, particularly because you have so
routed them. Neither do I blame you, so all-fired
much, because you just haven’t given it enough
thought so far, but listen&mdash;</p>

<p>Years ago, where I was raised, it was a great
country for raspberries. As you know, the berry
season is a pretty short one and the farmers raising
them had to depend to no small extent on hiring a
gang of boys just out of school to pick them. All us
fellows were pretty anxious about that time of the
year to earn a little pocket money and we descended
on those berry patches like a swarm of bees. Usually,
the days were pretty hot and when night came,
we were a pretty tired bunch of Indians and although
we worked pretty hard we hadn’t earned a great
deal for we were paid so much per quart.</p>

<p>One of the boys used to turn in about twice as
many berries every day as the rest of us and the
farmer used to tell us every night the reason he did
so was because he put more berries in the pail than
he did in his mouth. Of course, that line of talk
was pretty good berry patch repartee, but it set me
thinking because I knew I was just as quick as the
other fellow; that I worked as hard and I didn’t like
raspberries anyway, so I knew I wasn’t wasting any
on the consumer’s pack method, so, one night I
caught up with the star picker on his way home and
asked him for the secret. He looked at me and
chuckled and said, “Come on home with me and get
my Dad to tell you.” This aroused my thirteen year
old curiosity, so I went along with him. When we
got home we found his father on the back porch and
he said, “Dad, tell my pal here what you told me
about picking berries.”</p>

<p>It happened that this boy’s Dad was one of those
fellows who knew all about boys, so he didn’t answer
the question right off, but first began by talking regular
boy’s lore&mdash;all about swimmin’ holes, how the
fish were bitin’, where we’d be liable to find an
eagle’s nest and a lot of the kind of things boys like
us were interested in&mdash;you know Red, the kind of
a Dad who just had you hanging on to every little
thing he said and just making you wish you could
go tramping with a Dad like that and the first thing
I knew&mdash;before I realized it&mdash;he had me telling him
what success I was having at berry picking.</p>

<p>After I’d described my methods and told him how
hard I worked, he said, “Son, now listen to me, for
this applies to berry picking as well as lots of other
things&mdash;when you go into a berry patch, you’ll find
lots of boys running here and there looking for
bushes where the berries grow the thickest. After
picking a few minutes they get the idea that a bush
a little farther down offers greater possibilities and
they run over to it and keep on repeating the performance
all day long. When night comes, they are
tired out from their exertions and strange to say,
they haven’t many berries in their pails either. Now
the way to do&mdash;when you go into a berry patch, stop
at the first bush you come to and don’t leave it
until you’ve picked every berry&mdash;don’t run aimlessly
from one bush to another, but do as I
say and when night comes you’ll find you not only
will have a full pail many times over, but you will
not be so tired, because you haven’t expended that
energy of yours running around so much. In other
words, “stick to your bush, son, stick to your bush.”</p>

<p>That’s all there is to the story, Red. Suffice to say
I took the old boy’s advice and sure enough it paid
dividends. Now the same thing applies to selling
goods. It’s human nature for youth especially, to
chase rainbows and follow what seems to be the
easiest way. When you get out of the bus in a small
town, which has four big prospects that you know you
can sell right along in a row on Main Street, it’s
quite natural to go sell ’em and then go to the depot
and catch the first train out, but, Red&mdash;how about
those three little stores way down the other side of
the feather factory, about four blocks from the
round house? Who is going to sell them? Their
credit is good and they’ll buy your goods if they get
a chance. Of course, I know the argument that the
little red devil who sits on your shoulder whispers
in your ear&mdash;it goes something like this, “I just
haven’t time; I’d miss that train out; I’ll pick the
good ones and leave the little ones for my competitor&mdash;he
has to live, etc.” and a thousand such logical
(?) arguments, but listen Boy&mdash;you know and I
know that the fellow who listens to those arguments
is only kidding himself.</p>

<p>Did you ever sit down Red and analyze a day’s
work with one of your salesmen? Figure out just
how many hours each day he actually spends face
to face with a buyer? If you never have, it will surprise
you both. Of course, I realize some time must
be spent going from store to store, and from town
to town, but regardless of that Red, the time you
spend facing the buyer is, after all, the only time in
the day that is really “productive time”&mdash;the balance
is “non-productive” and in addition, it’s expensive
because you cannot make it up&mdash;it’s gone.</p>

<p>The thinking Sales Manager and Salesman today
cannot fail to recognize this, because the man who
spends the most hours actually picking berries, gets
paid more than the fellow who spends half his time
between bushes.</p>

<p>Give my very best to ’em the next time you have
them in for a meeting and tell them for me that in
selling goods this year, I’d rather be a setter pup
that stalks the game, than a humming bird that just
dips its nose into what appears to be the sweetest
roses.</p>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>I just put down the evening paper and came very
nearly dropping off to sleep when your mother reminded
me that I’d better answer your last letter
tonight while I had the time and there was no
company around.</p>

<p>I think I enjoyed your last letter more than any
you’ve written recently, largely because it breathed
a better spirit of optimism over general business
conditions and your job in particular and I must
say that it was the first letter you have sent me
lately in which you were not “crabbing” about something
or other.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see those symptoms. For the life of me
I cannot see why a big, red-headed galoot like you,
with a good job, a superior line of merchandise and
a world of possibilities before you would find time to
do anything else but figure out ways and means of
capitalizing your opportunities to the fullest extent
and I really believe you are “rounding to” and if so&mdash;if
the signs don’t fail me&mdash;you’re just now putting
yourself into a correct mental attitude to commence
to really grow.</p>

<p>You know, Red, the only real place in life for a
“crab” is in the bottom of the restless ocean. Of
course, I know they occasionally get out of that
sphere, but when they do they generally get gobbled
up by some quicker thinking member of either the
fish or the human family, so there’s really no credit
to be gained by trying to pattern after an imitation
devil-fish.</p>

<p>I’ve done a good deal of thinking about that
snappy looking bunch of salesmen you’ve gathered
around you, as I mentioned in my last letter, and
I’ve been wondering if you’re going to turn out to be
a good “picker” of men, or if you just happened to
bump up against a kind Providence. I’m going to
give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that
you selected them carefully, with an eye to the
future, but your responsibility has only begun now
that you’ve separated the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>Next to trying to build a Ziegfeld chorus with a
bunch of knock-kneed runners-up in a cafeteria, I
don’t know any harder job than trying to make business
men and executives out of a bunch of potential
baseball fans, pool sharks and dance hounds, but
someone has to do it and it’s not a colossal task, Boy,
if you approach it with the proper amount of
tolerance and patience.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, it was my privilege to accidentally
meet the directing head of one of the largest industries
in this country. As we chatted over our cigars,
I inquired to what single thing he attributed the success
of his company. He replied quickly, “The exceptional
personnel of our organization.” Being in
an inquisitive mood and finding him a willing&mdash;yes&mdash;an
enthusiastic talker regarding his company, I
further inquired the method in training men for
higher and more responsible positions in his company.
He replied, “Our organization some years
back got away from the prehistoric idea that the
secrets of each job should be locked in the heart of
the man holding it.</p>

<p>“You know, in olden times, men were afraid to teach
subordinates for fear they would become so proficient
that they would crowd out the one holding the good
job. The constant and ever-increasing demand for
men qualified to hold the highest positions has
generated a feverish anxiety and ambition to train
men to take the place of his immediate superior, so
that practically every man, from the office boy to the
president, is competing with each other to turn out
the most and highest caliber experts and executives.”</p>

<p>Waxing reminiscent, this great man related how
one man in their organization, whose hair was now
silvered by many winters, was the “daddy” over a
hundred of the bigger men of the company&mdash;the
man who chose and had trained over a hundred men
to be capable of assuming the greater responsibilities
of a great industry! Naturally enough our
smoking-car conversation carried us to the discussion
of just what was the measure of success in the
business world and I think you can appreciate that
I was not at all surprised to hear this man&mdash;this
great captain of industry, whose very name in the
business world was synonymous with great accomplishments&mdash;say
with no little show of feeling, “If,
when I pass out of active business life, it can truthfully
be said of me that I was a builder of men, I
crave no greater epitaph.”</p>

<p>Red, that man spake a sermon in one sentence!
Boy, the pyramids of Egypt have already been built;
man in his wisdom has built skyscrapers, bridged
rivers and spanned plains, yet the greatest work of
the artisan, the noblest piece of sculpture and the
most magnificent monument of the ages is in your
hands for fashioning. The organization that you
have the honor to be a part of is a breathing, living
thing.</p>

<p>If the men who serve under your direction, Red,
are not allowed to grow&mdash;if their ambition is not
aroused to a point where they fit themselves with
your help to take your job, or jobs like it, you cannot
hope to gain promotion. Leaving out the personal
side of it, if yourself and men in similar positions
accept your present positions with smug satisfaction
and take no part in an effort to be constantly
building, the foundation of your house will surely
crumble as dry rot and decay sets in and your
temple will some day fall upon your head.</p>

<p>And Red, don’t be selfish to the point of being
afraid of personal handicaps that you might impose
on yourself. Your company needs trained branch
house managers, district managers, sales managers
and other executives. If they choose your right-hand
man and leave a hole in your organization,
don’t grouch about it&mdash;don’t complain about their
having broken up your organization&mdash;Good Lord,
Boy, what higher compliment could they pay you
than to thus acknowledge that they consider you a
builder of men? Just start in and train another, for
the day you can honestly walk in and tell the Boss
that you’ve trained a man who can fill your place
better than you can, he will not waste much time
finding a bigger and better job for you, Red.</p>

<p>While I think you’re too young to really appreciate
the pride one feels in the successes of their own
children, you can take it from me it’s some feeling
and I don’t know anything in this world that’s so
closely akin to it as the satisfaction and genuine
pleasure one derives in watching the successes of
those men whom you have personally coached in
their earlier successes.</p>

<p>Think it over Boy! The duty you owe to your company,
or the world at large, isn’t at all performed
when you have merely achieved personal success&mdash;why
bless your heart, one graduate from Red’s
school is worth more to the company than a single
sale of the entire output of their largest cannery.</p>

<p>Fate has entrusted to your keeping as likely looking
a bunch of youngsters as I’ve seen in many a
day. What are YOU going to do with ’em old Red
Top? Are you going to be satisfied with just making
good salesmen out of them&mdash;are you short-sighted
enough to think that’s all that’s expected of you?</p>

<p>Mother and I were discussing these things the
other night and she gradually led me out over my
head in the argument. She always goes way back
before my time and she did when she said that God
made the first man out of a bunch of clay. The only
comeback I could think of was, “Gee, what an inspiration
that ought to be to Red, considering how
much better material he has to work with.”</p>

Is Winning the Respect of Men</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Jim Baker came by the house a few minutes ago
and showed me a copy of last week’s bulletin in
which was the announcement of your promotion to
the position of District Manager. Your letter of a
few days ago didn’t say anything about it, although
you must have known at the time. Guess you wanted
to surprise your old Dad, eh&mdash;what? But you didn’t
surprise me much after all, for I’ve been expecting
something like that to happen to you for a long time.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;Boy&mdash;Howdy! I know you’re proud of the
promotion and I’m sure proud too, but I’m not going
to do much back slapping for two reasons. In the
first place, it makes your arm tired and the second
place, it will not help you a bit to fill a District
Manager’s shoes. The very fact that you didn’t wire
me right after the job was given you is a good sign.
I’m giving you credit at least for inherited modesty
and if I am right in my diagnosis, I’m more proud
still for I never knew a big man in my life who
wasn’t personally modest and I’m happier than I
can tell you to think that at the outset you are exhibiting
the ear marks of the man I’m hoping
you are.</p>

<p>No doubt you are full of plans of what you are
going to do in the new work and probably don’t need
any advice from me, but I know that by this time
you realize that it’s the old man’s prerogative to
make a few comments in each letter, so I’m not
worrying a bit about whether you want them or not.</p>

<p>The position of District Manager is a big one&mdash;a
whole lot bigger than some think. It’s one of those
jobs that a fellow can make just about as big as he
wants to and, on the other hand, it furnishes an
opportunity for a fellow to make about as big a
jackass of himself as the proverbial Missouri mule,
if you don’t watch your step.</p>

<p>In the first place, I hope you haven’t acquired the
idea that the place was given you because you were
the best branch house manager on the force; the
seventh son of a seventh son or because they thought
you were too big for a branch house manager. Of
course, I don’t know how they arrived at their conclusion,
but if I were you I think I’d figure that
probably they were pretty short of District Manager
material and just decided to try you out on the
job for a few months to see how you’d work out.</p>

<p>Don’t get the idea that I’m trying to make light
of your ability&mdash;far from it. The only reason I’m
advising you that way is, I believe that thought on
your part would make for a more healthy condition
and provide more of an incentive. At any rate, the
officials of your company, to all practical purposes,
are “from Missouri” and you’ll do well not to kid
yourself into thinking you have been especially
ordained a modern Moses to lead the children of
Israel out of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Of course, I know you don’t think so, but I want
to impress upon you that your new job is no sinecure.
Unless you have a perverted sense of what is
expected of you, you’ll find that your previous positions
were child’s play in comparison. You have
taken upon yourself a world of responsibility that
must not be discounted. While you may believe yourself
to be popular with the organization under your
jurisdiction, it’s a hundred-to-one shot that&mdash;especially
at first&mdash;you’ll be about as popular as the village
drunkard at a Sunday School Picnic. Your
managers might have liked you as a brother manager,
but it’s only natural that they’ll accept you
only on suspicion until you’ve demonstrated to them
that you’re a rudder on the boat instead of a
barnacle.</p>

<p>That’s your first and biggest job, old Red Top, and
if you’re smart you’ll realize that although the title
may carry some prestige, the most important commodity
you have to sell at first is&mdash;Red. Be sure to
differentiate between the class of men you have been
directing and those now under your jurisdiction.
Although your managers were once salesmen&mdash;they’re
managers now. Big, broad, clear-thinking,
hard-hitting business men. You cannot succeed without
their respect and you haven’t got that to start
with, because you’ve yet to demonstrate. You cannot
buy respect of these men with fancy dinners,
too much dignity, funny stories or “old maid” tactics.
Your authority of title or position don’t mean
anything to them. You must be first a “he-man,”
the happy medium between a “yes-ser” and a
chronic debater, an exponent and amplifier of your
company’s policies, a happy mixture of hard work,
tolerance, constructive suggestion and leadership.</p>

<p>Don’t hold that respect to be attained lightly&mdash;worry
about it! If there’s a single manager that will
not co-operate and the others do, it would look as
though it were his fault&mdash;not yours, but if six out of
the ten are luke-warm after you’ve been on the job a
while, that’s a condition and looks like your fault and
is plenty big enough to worry about. After you’ve
burned the midnight oil long enough on either of the
two cases, you’ll probably come to the conclusion
that you will sell yourself to that one man, or get rid
of him, because a balky manager&mdash;a man not in step
with the aims of the company&mdash;the fellow who doesn’t
believe in the policies and methods one hundred per
cent, is like a rotten apple in a barrel of good ones&mdash;if
you leave it there long enough, it will have the
whole barrel on the garbage wagon. But in the case
of the six out of ten who are not working right, it
should be obvious that it’s another case of “they were
all out of step but Jim” so you’d better take yourself
off to one side, hold a few star chamber sessions and
operate on Red. You’re the point of contact, Boy,
between the officers and directors and the sales
organization.</p>

<p>During the war you heard a lot about morale, and
morale is nothing more-or-less than mental attitude&mdash;point
of view. Yet, morale has overthrown
dynasties, won battles and brought success out of
failure. The sales battle of your company will not
be won unless it is ever-apparent in the salesmen&mdash;the
salesmen cannot be expected to have it unless
their managers believe, with an infinite faith, in the
aims, policies and personnel of your institution and
those managers cannot be expected to have it unless
their point of contact with the dynamos in the power
house are capable of carrying the proper voltage
with an unbroken current, rather than be merely a
broken live-wire that can only sputter, fuss and
shock those with whom it comes in contact.</p>

<p>Boy, this has been a rambling letter and I hope
the things I’ve told you will prove entirely unnecessary,
but you’re just now embarking on an uncharted
sea. You’ll no doubt run into breakers, squalls and
stormy weather, yet, there is bound to be clear sailing
ahead of you if you’ll be ever alert to stay off
the rocks of conceit, leisure and intolerance.</p>

<p class="loving">Your loving,</p>
<p class="dad">“DAD.”</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Am sending you that hat you won on the
election bet. You’ll note that it’s the same size as the
last one I bought you.</p>

and Finds the Spirit of the Time</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>I’ve been reading a great deal recently in the
newspapers and magazines, particularly in articles
relating to sales problems, about the new order of
things with respect to this year rewarding only fighters.
In addition to what you say in your letters
about your own company’s activities, the bulletins and
circular letters you have sent me, it seems that every
sales talk I listen to, or read, bears down particularly
on that very apparent change that has come
about in all business in recognizing changed conditions
and cutting your expense-cloth according to
your result-pattern.</p>

<p>You know, you sent me a copy of a letter not long
ago written by the Big Boss himself, in which he
said that they did not contemplate reducing their
man power, but he said he expected you to do away
with all incompetents; have one good man do the
work of two mediocre ones and he intimated in no
uncertain terms that your company had no use for
drones around its bee-hive.</p>

<p>I have been just a little mite curious to get around
and see just how literally your organization was
taking the instructions so I welcomed the chance
that presented itself last week when some business
took me out of town for a few days. I happened in
a town, Red, in which your company had a branch
house (not in your territory, Boy, although I wished
it were). This was what might be called a baby-branch,
in that it has been in operation only a few
months. Not having much to do, I dropped around
to chat with the manager. The thing that first impressed
me was that although it was before eight
A. M. they were on the job and working. The next
thing I noticed was that they didn’t have any surplus
office furniture to loll around in. In fact, after
I introduced myself and indicated that I was going
to stay a few minutes anyway, they had quite a time
finding something for me to sit on.</p>

<p>A funny coincidence was, the manager was red-headed
and sitting across the desk from him was a
red-headed youngster who reminded me a good deal
of you when you were his age. As I sat there chatting
with the manager, I just couldn’t keep my eyes
off that boy. Evidently he was office manager,
voucher clerk, cashier, chief clerk and everything in
the office except the stenographer. The stenographer,
by-the-way, was a young man about the same age as
the red-head who wasn’t bothered about having to
powder his nose, fix his back hair, or go to the rest
room every twenty minutes like some female stenographers
I’ve heard of.</p>

<p>Both of these chaps were neatly dressed and a
credit in appearance to the office. About nine o’clock
Red (I’ll just have to call him that) said to the
stenographer “Come on, Boy, let’s go” and both of
them got up from their desks and went out the door.
I didn’t think much of that until a few minutes later
I heard the clanking of chains and squeaking of pulleys
and looking out I saw Red and the stenographer&mdash;now
dressed in overalls and jumpers&mdash;out bringing
stock down from the third floor to the shipping
floor by means of a chain and pulley.</p>

<p>I questioned the manager and he said their business
there so far was small and his entire force was
himself and those two boys. It was, of course, obvious
that had he a combination warehouseman and
shipping clerk he couldn’t be kept busy but about
half the time, so the work must therefore be done by
his present force. I watched those fellows while
they brought down some hundred or more cases,
stenciled them, piled them neatly on the sidewalk in
front awaiting the transfer wagons. When finished
they came back in the office, picked up their office
work where they left off and went to it. I was so
interested in that combination that I made it convenient
to stay around there all day&mdash;I was afraid
there was a joker in it some place and I wanted to
see. When the transfer man came Red went out and
helped load the goods onto the wagon. He wasn’t
very big physically&mdash;just a boy I tell you&mdash;but you
should see him get a toe-hold on those pickle barrels.
Why, Strangler Lewis never had a thing on him in
his palmiest days&mdash;and smile&mdash;Red&mdash;why doggone
it he was actually happy in that job and took just as
much interest in his work as if he owned the place.</p>

<p>In talking with the manager he got to explaining
the different routes of his salesmen and I noticed on
the map that there were several large towns that his
salesmen didn’t touch. When I asked him specifically
about them, he told me he worked them himself and
he gave me to understand that he wasn’t one of
those chair-warming “directors of sales” but a real,
red-blooded, hard-hitting he-manager&mdash;one who sent
in orders in the same mail with his expense account.
It was very apparent that in addition to working the
trade he also found time to direct his salesmen,
answer his correspondence and be all that a branch
manager should be.</p>

<p>Red, I walked out of that branch and down the
street and do you know what I was thinking of?
Well, I’ll tell you&mdash;do you remember that grand old
patriotic picture of the drummer, the fifer and the
color bearer, tattered, wounded and bandaged, but
with set jaws, courage and determination fairly
bristling from them&mdash;that picture’s called, “The
Spirit of ’76”? Well, Boy, I couldn’t help but think
of the similarity of the spirit portrayed in the picture
and that evidenced by that two-fisted, working
manager with his two combination office-men,
stenographer, shipping clerk, and warehouseman.</p>

<p>Now, of course, I suppose you’ve got men working
for you who would say, if you told them about this
occurrence, that they thought it was beneath a
man’s dignity to do the things those fellows did and
perhaps they’re right in it too, as applied to some
places and some conditions. I know all of your managers
cannot spend seventy-five per cent of their time
out getting orders; I know that office managers, clerks
and stenographers cannot be shipping clerks and
warehousemen in addition to their other duties, but
the big thought I want to get across to you Red, is
that here was a place where it not only could be done,
but necessary that it should be done if that baby-branch
was to get a foot-hold and live, and the beautiful
part about it all was, it was done, cheerfully,
happily and with a determination to win just like
the spirit that was in the minds and hearts of those
grand old boys at Valley Forge.</p>

<p>You know, one of the chief duties of a district
manager is to be continually on the lookout for good
timber&mdash;a sort of a scout for the Big League as
’twere. All I have to say is&mdash;keep your eye on that
combination.</p>

<p class="loving">Your loving,</p>
<p class="dad">“DAD.”</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I’ll bet you a new brown derby that red-headed
kid will not be pushing pencils and juggling
pickle barrels all his life.</p>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Mother and I have been sitting out in the porch
swing all evening watching the neighborhood youngsters
play ball in the street. In the bunch was one
red-headed boy, who, of course, reminded me a little
of you when you were his age and it was only natural
that I got to musing a little over your experiences
and problems and I couldn’t help wondering just
what kind of ball you were now playing.</p>

<p>After the last youngster had heeded the paternal
whistle and laid aside his ball and glove for the
night, the shouts died down, the street became quiet
and Mother and I sat out there in the twilight talking
of you&mdash;your good points and bad points&mdash;your
fads, fancies and pet peeves. We fell to discussing
your qualifications for this job of district manager
that you have had now for some time and wondering
if you were finding it possible to control that bombastic,
nitro glycerin, TNT disposition of yours, in
the face of trying circumstances that I know you
have to face daily.</p>

<p>I don’t know that I ever told you, but I have had
the privilege of knowing and studying different district
managers&mdash;not in your concern, but in other
lines where the problems are somewhat similar. I
was telling Mother about some of the species I had
met up with in my time and durned if she didn’t
spring a couple of quotations from the Scriptures
(just like Mother, isn’t it?) that seemed to fit my
line of musing so well that I just thought I’d use
’em for a basis&mdash;a sort of Golden Text as ’twere and
come in and write you a letter before I forgot what
I wanted to say.</p>

<p>The particular district manager I was telling her
about at the time, was a fellow whom I was pretty
well acquainted with in the old days. He was a bright
fellow, one who knew his game about as well as any
I ever met and those in power in his company had
every reason to expect him to make a big success.
He was a good salesman&mdash;had more than ordinary
knowledge of the fine points of the manufacturing
end, had had a broad experience and was a keen
analyst.</p>

<p>This man was a likeable chap and had taken more
than a correspondence course in diplomacy and tact,
so there wasn’t anything on the surface that would
indicate other than smooth sailing in his job, but
the boys on the road who ran onto him frequently,
soon began to intimate to their confidants that he
wasn’t making such a success as it was thought he
would.</p>

<p>One day I got hung up on a big deal where I had
to wait over a couple of days before I could get the
signature on the dotted line and I accidentally met
this chap in the dining room of the hotel one morning.
After he found out I had a little time to kill he
asked me if I wouldn’t like to go with him to call on
one of the branches under his jurisdiction. I guess
it was curiosity more than anything else that
prompted my acceptance of his invitation, but anyway,
we went over to the branch in that city and all
I had to do was to sit over in a corner of the private
office, read a newspaper&mdash;or rather pretend to&mdash;and
watch the wheels go ’round.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was a sort of new dignity
that he assumed the minute we walked into the office&mdash;pleasant
enough and smiling as he saluted the
manager and clerks, but you know Red, one of those
“holier-than-thou” atmospheres seemed to creep into
the room like a Lake Michigan fog in late October.
Not being familiar with the fine points of the business
I wasn’t able to get much from the various conversations
that I overheard during the day, but I
particularly noticed that every once in a while the
manager would relate some particularly good thing
that had come to pass and invariably the district
manager would lean back and say, “Sure, I’m responsible
for that!” or “Didn’t I tell you how to do
that?” or some such comment. Whenever those remarks
were made I noticed particularly that the
manager’s face would sort of lengthen and he apparently
bit his lip a time or two, as I surmised, to keep
from telling the D. M. that he too should share in
the glory.</p>

<p>Several times during the day while the district
manager and manager were discussing some problem,
various clerks and stenographers would come in
for a decision, or deliver some verbal message and it
was noticeable beyond mistake that the district manager
always answered the question, or handed down
the decision, regardless of the fact that the manager
was the one usually addressed. Later on in the day
in discussing some situations they did not always
agree on all points and mild, but healthy, argument
arose. In such cases, the district manager invariably
raised his voice to a high pitch, to all appearances
lost his temper and in effect, brow-beat and bulldozed
the poor little manager into an eventual agreement
on the point in question.</p>

<p>When we got ready to leave, I know it was more
than imagination when I noticed the look of tired
relief that came into the eyes of the manager and I
couldn’t help but feel a deep sympathy for him, because
instead of receiving helpful suggestions and
counsel, encouragement and intelligent, collaborated
analysis, he had only been subjected to ill-concealed
egotism and arrogance, had been belittled in the eyes
of his subordinates and shouted at like a coolie-laborer
on a steamship dock.</p>

<p>When I came to this place in my narrative, Mother
just gazed out over the chimney tops of the homes
across the street into the canopy of stars that twinkle
over you tonight, the same as they twinkle over
us and said, “Well, Red will never be that kind of
district manager, because he’ll remember that part
of the Scriptures that says, “He that exalteth himself
shall be abased, but he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted” and again in Proverbs where it
says, “A soft answer turneth away wrath, but
grievous words stir up anger.”</p>

<p>I didn’t have any comeback, Red; I hope Mother’s
right (she usually is) and I’m not laying any odds
on whether you remember the Biblical quotations,
but I am willing to vote with her on your being
smart enough to keep from assuming that cheap
variety of dignity that only looks good on an undertaker;
that faculty of self-effacement when it means
the strengthening of another’s position in the eyes
of his subordinates and having the breeding to speak
with firmness, but in a low voice, that can only make
for respect and withal, a love&mdash;if you please&mdash;in the
hearts of your fellow-workers that is more priceless
than empty-sounding titles, fame, or five figures on
the salary check.</p>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>I got a letter the other day from an optimistic
friend of mine out in the short grass country, where
the principal industry is cattle raising. He admitted
that, like all other business his particular line had
gone through its depression, but I couldn’t help but
be impressed with his cheerfulness. Among other
things, he told me that they had experienced an awful
dry spell out his way, but that the cattle business
wasn’t so bad after all. He seemed to be full of pity
for the poor hog raiser, for he said that it had been
so dry that the natives had to soak up their hogs by
turning water on them before they could get them
to hold slop.</p>

<p>Somehow this set me to thinking about your business
and having a little spare time on my hands I
thought I’d drop down to the main office of your
company to renew old acquaintances and to listen to
the gossip. When I got down there, the first thing
that impressed me was the pruning that had been
going on in the office force. I didn’t see any strange
faces to speak of on my visit, but I noticed the
absence of a good many whose duties during the war
period were no doubt dignified by the title of First
and Second Pencil Sharpener and Envoy Extraordinary
to His Flipness, the Office Boy, and other
strange and sundry nonessentials that crept into all
offices during the period of commercial hysteria that
we have been recovering from in the last year.</p>

<p>Everybody had their coats off and were working
under high pressure and I had considerable difficulty
getting anyone to talk to me. I suppose it was out of
respect for the fact that I have a red-headed son on
the payroll, that finally got an audience for me with
the Boss and we had a very pleasant chat. He told
me that business was much better than it had been
and took me down past the order desk where the old
time activity was beginning to show again. He always
takes me into his confidence in illustrating his
points and I was particularly impressed by some of
the letters from salesman managers that were
coming in.</p>

<p>It was really amusing to a fellow like me, Red,
who has been out of touch with the present situation
to quite an extent, particularly his illustrations of
the mental attitude of different managers. The majority
of letters he showed me were written in an
enthusiastic, optimistic tone and recited the
strengthening of the market on certain items and
were accompanied by contracts for futures, as well
as a spot business, while some few were evidently
written by managers who didn’t know that the
wholesale grocers had taken their last fall sugar
losses and were still devoting their time to thinking
up fancy alibis for poor business.</p>

<p>After so long a time, we got to talking about you
Red, and I suppose he just wanted to tickle an old
man’s parental pride, but anyway he said some nice
things about the way you were getting along. He
told me something in confidence that I’m going to tip
off to you, although he said you didn’t know yet, but
am sure he will not mind my telling you. He said
that the first of next month you were to be brought
into the Chicago office as one of his product sales
managers. Just about that time he was called into a
meeting and had to tell me good-bye hurriedly and as
a result, I didn’t get to find out just what job it was,
or whether it was permanent, or just a tryout for
you, but anyway, I went home walking on air for,
regardless of what it is or whether or not it is a
promotion, it certainly will be a change of base
for you and will add to your already diversified
experience.</p>

<p>Now Red, I’ve spent a lot of time in my life watching
the antics (yes&mdash;I say that advisedly) of some of
these product sales managers and there are several
things I want to warn you of before you tackle the
job. In the first place, the biggest mistake you could
make would be to get the impression that all you had
to do was to “direct” the efforts of the organization on
the particular items you were following. Of course,
you’ll have some of that, but if you think you will
only have to dictate to a good looking stenographer,
you’re as mistaken as a republican candidate for
alderman in the first ward. And again, if on account
of your army experience you imagine you’re going to
be top sergeant for the general sales manager and
let him carry the responsibility you’d better stick
pins in your chair and come out of it.</p>

<p>The only excuse for having a product sales manager
is that the particular product in question will
have a “daddy” in the main office, instead of having
to be nurtured a la incubator and grow up like
Topsy. Don’t think for a minute that the general
sales manager is going to do the thinking for you, or
lay down a set of instructions for you to follow out.
I take it that you’re getting more than twelve dollars
a week now and if so, they expect you to be
“creative” and use that torch-thatched swelling on
top of your shoulders for something else beside a
hat-rack.</p>

<p>Now get this clear to start with&mdash;everything the
company manufactures in your line is YOUR product.
Yours to sell&mdash;it doesn’t belong to the factory,
the branch house, the jobber, the retailer or the
consumer. It’s YOURS&mdash;the weight of responsibility
is on your shoulders from the time it comes out of
the retort until the can is peacefully reposing on the
breeze-swept side of the hillock in the city dumping-ground.
If you think you can sit down and dictate
a “pep” letter to managers and salesmen, wave your
arms and plant Old Glory rhetorically in the azure
blue of the heavens until some temperamental manager
becomes so moved by your chin music that he
orders a carload&mdash;if you think you have then accomplished
something worth crowing over, you better
go back to calling on the retail trade. Those goods
are yours, Red&mdash;you’ve only then started them in
the channel of distribution and the REAL WORK
for your think-tank has only commenced. You must
think up schemes&mdash;selling plans&mdash;watch stocks and
keep them moving&mdash;give advice and counsel to your
managers&mdash;in a word, you must be the dynamo that
generates the sell-juice and believe me, it’s your job
to see there are no broken connections.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things about a product sales
manager’s job that can be well or poorly done, but I
cannot begin to comment on all of them in this letter.
Am sorry I didn’t get to talk just a few minutes
longer to your Boss, for I’m curious to know whether
they thought you were so all-fired good at your other
job that they gave you this, or whether somebody
just left the gate open and you sneaked in.</p>

<p>I haven’t told your mother about this yet, so I
suggest that you write her a letter and just mention
it casual-like. After I get her comments I’ll write
you some more of my observations, which I imagine
you relish about as much as salt in your ice cream.</p>

to the Farm</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Every year about this time I get a sort of hankerin’
for yellow-legged chicken and striped gravy&mdash;you
know, Red&mdash;not the kind you see on the bill-of-fare
in the cafes which they jokingly term “spring”
chicken, without going on record as to just what
spring; not the kind that’s cooked all in one piece
and tastes like the pet chicken that Grover Cleveland
raised when he was in the White House; but rather
that old-fashioned, unjointed, juicy, tender, fried-brown
country chicken that you’re sure first saw
the light of day about May 1st, this year.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, Mother and I piled into the old gas
buggy last Sunday and went out in the country just
in order to satisfy that craving. You know, Red, I
never had a particularly strong leaning toward the
farm or anything that goes with it, with the exception
of an occasional visit made with the sole intent
of just gorging myself on the good things to eat that
the farmer always seems to find right handy without
having to haggle with the grocer over the price. Not
that I thought I was better than the farmer&mdash;not
that I didn’t appreciate that he was the backbone of
the nation, and this and that and this and that, but
somehow or other I just never did fall for those
poetic rhapsodies and popular songs that usually tell
in a high falsetto how dear the old meadow and pigpen
were to the heart of a prodigal son. You know
I always had the secret hunch that all of that patter
was mostly bunk and was written only for commercial
purpose to be sold to and raved over by some
little mouse of a shop-girl that was trying to carve
out a career as a counter-jumper in a department-store
basement or by some lonesome hick that had
come into the city expecting to conquer it and Cook
County in three months and was having trouble to
rustle shoes for himself on his salary as a bus boy in
a one-arm chair feed-bag oasis.</p>

<p>I have made the mistake of looking on the farm
as a sort of necessary evil where they just put the
seed in the ground every spring and then let nature
do its worst and the reason I didn’t wake up sooner
was because I’d been stopping too much at these
near-farms where they advertise chicken dinners for
two dollars and have an electric piano and a toddle
parlor just back of the dining room.</p>

<p>On the way down to the place I was going, I drove
up to a pretty likely looking farm with a big red
barn and went in. It was a fancy stock farm and
much to my surprise they had electric lights, radiators
and an electric fan over each stall. They had
some blooded cows in there that they milked four
times a day&mdash;the attendants were all dressed in
white like barbers in a loop shop and the only thing
that was missing was the blonde manicurist. Even
the pigs were washed and primped up and the thing
that struck me so funny was that the manager in
his conversation actually showed that by running it
that way, it paid dividends on the investment. To
make a long story short, I went along on my journey
impressed with the fact that the fellow who ran
that place wasn’t just indulging a fad or hobby but
rather was making a success because of brains and
because he knew his business. That started me
thinking and when I arrived at the farm that had
agreed to feed me for a day I was viewing things in a
new light.</p>

<p>When I stretched out on the cool back porch after
a meal that can be gotten only on a real farm&mdash;out
there where the very sky seems to come a little
closer, where the traffic officer’s whistle would be
sacrilegious and the smell of burning gasoline was
only a memory&mdash;I fell to talking business with my
host. I found that I had this farmer business all
wrong. True, it was a hard life and a gamble with
the elements; true, the price of farm products had
been taking a merry toboggan; but I found a spirit
of optimism&mdash;a studied forgetfulness of the drab
part of it&mdash;a highly scientific and intelligent working
out of a problem that formerly I had guessed was
only happenstance. My host had a reason for planting
corn on the north eighty and oats on the east
quarter. The rations for his live stock were as carefully
planned as the contents of a baby’s nursing
bottle. In a word&mdash;he knew his business and as a
result these minor factors of price declines and other
annoyances were only an incident in the successful
carrying out of a well defined plan.</p>

<p>Naturally, Red, I got to thinking of you and your
work and I wondered if you were thoroughly impressed
with the necessity of your knowing your
business as you have never known it before. I wondered
if you could tell the Boss if he asked you right
quick the price your competitor was getting for
every one of the staple products in your line. I wondered
if you had a good knowledge of which
branches had too big a stock of certain items and
just what you were really doing to change that situation.
I wondered if you considered your slow stock
report&mdash;your Bible&mdash;and the thing to really worry
over. I wondered if you knew how much the plants
had of your product&mdash;just how it was moving and
just when you should recommend a packing order,
and then if such recommendation were made
whether it were based on it being the time of the
year when the raw material was the most reasonable.</p>

<p>I wondered if you appreciated that the successful
marketing of your own product rested largely on
your shoulders&mdash;yours for the planting&mdash;yours to
generate enthusiasm over&mdash;yours to be posted on as
no one else in the organization.</p>

<p>Coming home that night I was telling Mother of
the lessons that the day had taught. I asked her if
she thought that even you might not glean a lesson
from the farmer. It was funny, Red, to hear her.
I don’t know why except that to her, like all mothers,
you’re still just her baby boy&mdash;either that, or else
you’ve been practicing your salesmanship on her,
for she thinks that you’re ’way ahead of me on the
things I’ve been wondering about you. She actually
believes that you could take the man that first packed
food in cans and teach him something. Of course I
didn’t argue with her because I never won an argument
with Mother, but I just made up my mind that
I’d drop you a little note and tell you that if you
didn’t put the old one-two on the jaw of that problem
of yours by being the best posted man on your line
in the whole office, that it was going to make a
serious dent in the confidence of</p>

<p class="loving">Your loving,</p>
<p class="dad">“DAD.”</p>

<p>P. S. The only pessimist I found on the farm, Red,
was a bull-frog that croaked at night in the creek.
He reminded me of a certain type of salesman&mdash;he
didn’t sell anybody anything.</p>

Big Sales Contest</i></h2>
</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>Since you have been sending me copies of all the
circulars and bulletins gotten out by the General
Sales department, as well as your own department,
I have been kept pretty well informed as to what
your firm was doing and planning to do and I don’t
mind telling you that I’m as interested as a kid on
December twenty-third, in this latest stunt you’re
pulling&mdash;this national convention of leader salesmen
campaign.</p>

<p>There are several inferences that I draw from the
literature that’s been put out on it so far and I think
I see some angles to it that may have escaped you
and I figure you might be interested in just how this
all looks to an innocent bystander such as myself, so
I’m going to exercise my prerogative of commenting
copiously, as ’twere.</p>

<p>Before you get ready to tell me to keep my comments
to myself, I want to tell you about an introduction
I once had to a brother knight of the grip.
It was in my early days of order-teasing that I met
up with a prune peddler on my territory by the
name of George Shifflett. George was one of those
typical grocery salesmen of the old school. Happy,
well formed, jovial, a hale fellow well met, fairly
radiating good fellowship and, at the same time, a
salesman plus. I was called in to a strange city, and
before going I told George about it and mentioned
that time would perhaps hang rather heavily on my
hands. George sat down and wrote a little note of
introduction to a friend of his, whom he said would
give me an entree to anything and everything in that
town. Although the letter was not sealed, I didn’t
think to read it, but as soon as I arrived I hunted
up George’s friend and presented my credentials.</p>

<p>His friend was also a peddler of the George type.
He immediately opened up the letter and this is what
it said: “This is my friend&mdash;treat him kindly and
often.” Just how well George’s friend obeyed this
admonition is neither here nor there, and there’s no
use rubbing it in by referring to the customs of ancient
times, suffice to say that the only point in the
story in connection with my relations with you is
that in the comments I am continually making on
your business, I am merely trying to treat you
“Kindly and often”&mdash;not in the way George’s friend
treated me, but I hope in a more beneficial and less
bibulous manner.</p>

<p>But, to get down to this leader salesmen campaign&mdash;I
naturally begin first to look for holes in
such a plan, having gone through a good many campaigns
myself, but for the life of me I cannot find
any in your plan. It’s about the finest thing I’ve
ever seen. You know the trouble with most national
campaigns is that you have one house, or
one bunch of salesmen, competing with another on a
product on which the selling conditions vary greatly,
one part of the country with another. But, in this
one the salesmen merely compete with the salesmen
at the local branch, in an effort to determine just
what man in each class is the better salesman on a
fairly wide line of products. I cannot think of anything
that would create more rivalry among your
salesmen than your plans, for the convention program
that is laid out is both recreative and educational
and the big point that I’m sure will not be
overlooked by the men is the opportunity it affords
the winners to become better and more personally
acquainted with the men who direct their movements
and destinies.</p>

<p>You know, when I used to be a salesman I looked
on the Chicago office as being only just a little lower
than the pearly gates&mdash;almost as unattainable and
a place that could only be reached in the way of a
visit by the manager and an occasional special salesman.
I wondered how I could ever be picked for a
better job when the fellows who do the picking had
never seen me. It took me quite a while to break
into that holy of holies, and as I look back at it now,
it seems I must have had a lucky star for I finally
got in, but I had to wait a good many years and I
didn’t have the opportunity to win an introduction
such as is planned for the winning leader salesmen
in your campaign.</p>

<p>Now Red, listen to me&mdash;the success of this
campaign doesn’t depend entirely on the amount of enthusiasm
that your department sales manager and
the branch house managers generate. Not at all&mdash;they’ll
have the enthusiasm in sufficient quantity all
right&mdash;just leave that to the managers and salesmen.</p>

<p>This campaign will be won by one thing&mdash;plans&mdash;Red,
that’s the word&mdash;plans. No salesman is
going to kid himself into winning this campaign. The
fellow who wins will be the chap who first realizes
that there has been a change come over business in
the last few weeks. He’ll have a good idea of just
who he’s gunning for and his list will include every
merchant that has hinges on his door. He’ll have
samples and selling arguments on each of the campaign
items and he’ll not make the mistake of underestimating
the amount of goods that it’s possible to
sell each customer. Last, but not least, for the full
length of the campaign he’ll be up in the morning before
the proverbial rooster has a chance to crow, and
like the sign in the drug store window, he’ll “work
while you sleep.”</p>

<p>Red, it’s your job to lead. Are you giving those
boys the suggestions and selling arguments that it’s
your place to supply? You know the finest compliment
that can be paid you at the convention is to
have not one, but several of those snappy winners
slide up to you and tell you just how much help you
really gave in those plans.</p>

<p>Now, don’t give me the “busy signal.” Of course,
you’re busy&mdash;why shouldn’t you be, but listen Red&mdash;this
campaign is the most important thing that your
company is putting on this year&mdash;make it your first
and most important duty&mdash;lead ’em, Red, lead ’em!</p>

<p>You know, Boy, every time I think of your job and
your problems, I’m reminded of the difference between
a real live salesman in a clothing store and
one of the wax dummies in the window of that same
store. Both are salesmen after a fashion, and the
poor wax dummy that sits behind the plate glass all
day is doing his best and helping to sell goods in a
measure, but Red, you never bought a suit of clothes
of one of ’em in your life, now did you? No, you bet
you didn’t, but the boy with the Elgin movement and
the snappy sales argument, behind the counter
teased many an order away from you, now didn’t
he? All right&mdash;now the thought I’d like to leave
with you just before I take off my shoes and make
a midnight raid on the ice-box is:</p>

<p>That department sales manager chair that you’re
sitting in was never intended for the outer casing of
a mummy&mdash;shake ’em up, Red, and make it snappy!</p>

</div>

<p>
Dear Hal:<br />
</p>

<p>For once in my life, I confess to you that I’m
starting a letter that I don’t know how to write.</p>

<p>Mother and I just finished reading your telegram
that announced you had just been made general
sales manager of your company. While it was not
so much of a surprise in one way&mdash;it has been a
long while since you received your last promotion
and naturally we knew you would not be satisfied until
you had climbed even further up the ladder&mdash;still,
I am somehow differently impressed with this last
elevation of yours than I have with your previous
steps.</p>

<p>I don’t know how I could better illustrate my
feeling than to say that when you were a little fellow
about ten I started in to give you what I thought
at the time was training in the fundamentals of the
different stages of boyhood. I can look back now
and see where I used to hold myself up to you as a
sort of example. Yes, I’ll admit now that I used
to paint the Old Man as being quite some fellow in
his youth. While you seemed impressed from year
to year as the so-called schooling progressed and
were interested in my teachings, I realized finally
when your voice began to change and a peach-skin
fuzz began to form on your upper-lip that you weren’t
a little boy any more. Altho I recognized your
growth, not until your twenty-first birthday did I
realize that I must needs pursue a different plan, for
lo&mdash;my once little lad had suddenly grown to manhood
and if you’ll remember I ceased advising you
against the pitfalls that the boy must guard against
and began talking he-man language from then on.</p>

<p>Similarly, from the time you started as a salesman
for your company, until the present, I have
taken a keen delight in listening&mdash;sometimes with a
good deal of patience, but withal a great relish&mdash;to
your trials and problems as they came to you along
the same old road that I myself had traveled and I
kidded myself into thinking, at least, that probably
I was doing you some good by tearing pages from
my experience in the past and applying them to your
problems, and I never realized until just tonight that
like the other experience, I had been so busy being a
pal of yours that momentarily your gradual growth
had escaped me and I must now look upon you in a
new light&mdash;as being the equal, if not the superior, in
experience, knowledge and acumen of the Old Man
who’s tried to tutor you along the way.</p>

<p>General sales manager&mdash;Well, Boy, Howdy! My
hat is off to you, Red, with a couple of Salaams!
Needless to say, I knew you’d get there and again,
needless to say I know you’ll fill the chair.</p>

<p>Just for tonight, Red, now listen&mdash;just for tonight
I’m going to forget momentarily your title and
lapse into the old vein. After this, if you insist, I’ll
call you Mister Red, or any other title you wish, but
I just cannot resist the temptation of still imagining
you to be the same old impetuous, impulsive, don’t
give-a-dam Redhead who used to put wrinkles
into my forehead, and I’m going to talk to you
accordingly.</p>

<p>No, I never was a general sales manager, but I
know all about how the job should be run, just like
Harry Sparks knows all about raising babies&mdash;he
never had any. Red, did you ever see that play,
“If I Were King”? No? Well, neither did I, but
I imagine it’s something like the way I’m looking
at this new job of yours. I can well imagine your
feelings, anyway&mdash;especially these first few days
after your appointment.</p>

<p>I know you’re leaning over backwards trying to
act natural in this new job of yours. Every fellow
who comes up to wish you well you sort of
look over mentally and wonder if his good wishes
have a real kick, or if they’re about one-half of one
per cent. You are painfully aware that there are
those in the organization who think you have a
horse-shoe in your hip pocket, while others wonder
just how you got that way. One minute you wonder
if you look and act so that no one could suspect
a swelling of your hat rest and the next moment
you’re wondering if the Boss doesn’t wonder if
you’re sufficiently dignified for the place. All-in-all,
Old Top, I’ll bet you’re in a peculiar state of mind
and will remain so until the odor of mothballs and
the price tag wears off.</p>

<p>But, Red&mdash;forget it! You know they say that
good prize-fighters, or the best artists on the stage
are those who are totally oblivious to either boos
or applause, and forget their audience in the intensity
of their art. You’ve been handed a real job this
time and you should have neither the time, nor inclination,
to do other than put all your energy and
ability into it. Simply because it’s a big job, don’t
think for a minute that you will not continue to run
afoul of some things that will make that old red-headed
temper of yours assert itself, but, Boy, you’ll
have to handle it differently than in the old days.</p>

<p>You have heard how certain supposedly big
men when irritated used to chew up lead pencils,
turn over the desk and go thru divers forms of
brainstorms, but no, Red&mdash;that’s fiction&mdash;they’re
not doing it that way this summer. Do you remember
the illustration I gave you one time years
ago when you got all “het up” because a barber had
made a positive appointment with you when you
were in a hurry to catch a train and then broke it,
so you had to let the old brush-pile stay on? Remember,
I told you never to get mad at a man who was
below you in intelligence and if that fellow had any
intelligence he wouldn’t have been a barber? Well,
Red, the old rule will work in the new job&mdash;always
let the other fellow do the getting-mad thing; when
he does, he’ll make a fool of himself; if you get mad,
too, you’re getting down to his level.</p>

<p>Stick to the sales end, Red, as long as you’re in it,
at least. Don’t worry about how poorly the men in
the other ends of the business handle their duties.
God in all his infinite wisdom has never yet produced
a genus homo who was capable of personally directing
the manufacturing, selling, advertising and executive
ends of any one business. True, the president
of companies like yours does those things, but
not alone, Boy, not alone. He has a lot of high-class
men like yourself specializing and directing
certain ends of it. Don’t be too big, however, to
detect a good idea or suggestion from those in other
ends of the business. I once knew a great sales
manager who got the best sales lead of his experience
from an office boy.</p>

<p>And, Red, be human&mdash;keep away from the clouds&mdash;keep
your feet on terra firma. From the time of
the Man of Galilee who said, “Suffer little children
to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such
is the kingdom of heaven,” great men of all ages and
walks of life have realized that true greatness was
marked by humility. Have time, Boy, to listen to
the story of a problem solved that the junior clerk in
the department is just aching to tell you, and, Red,
like the other jobs you have held, be a leader. Now
more than ever before must you, by example and
precept, be a real leader of those you captain.</p>

<p>Much of your success will depend upon those with
whom you surround yourself. Be ultra conservative
in your selection. It may not have occurred to
you, but in choosing you for the big job those who
had your selection in their power observed pretty
carefully whether or not you had character. Character
is the solid foundation of all success; without
it no great heights can be reached and kept.</p>

<p>Boy, I could go on indefinitely, but I must close.
Even now, as the realization of your present age
and particularly your position strikes me anew, I
feel a sense of awe. I will not write you this way
any more&mdash;I’m done. Henceforth, my letters will
be postscripts on the bottom of Mother’s and will
only tell of my adventures chasing a little white ball
around a cow pasture. The mantle has fallen on
your broad and worthy shoulders&mdash;instead of my
telling you what to do, I’m resigned to have you give
me the post-graduate course, for as Kipling says:</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
